Regardless of recent swings, I'm net bullish and today, its likely prices might move higher and sync with April 15 bullish candlestick.\nFrom the News There are some pretty nice developments in the crypto world and because Bitcoin is the most dominant coin, expect to see wild allegation or over ambitious developments. One of them, depending on your view, is the rumor that there are solid plans of replacing SWIFT with the Bitcoin Network in Argentina. Well, this is definitely a BTC shot in the arm. However, the question is: Will the central bank and other dominant banks allow this? I expect a battle between affordability, transparency and decentralization and centralization, lags and inefficiency.\nAs things warm up, critics often assert their views whenever there is a BTC slide. Statistics shows that Bitcoin prices are down two percent in the last 24 hours and four percent in the last week. Now, despite being moderate losses, it's fodder for critics. One of them is Joe Davis of the Vanguard Group. Joe cannot be convinced otherwise and sees Bitcoin sliding all the way to zero.\n\"Bitcoin is an investment in blockchain in the same way that https://t.co/FNxmsV1r58 was an investment in the internet,\" says Vanguard's Joe Davis. https://t.co/IVxuJmJZei\n— MarketWatch (@MarketWatch) May 22, 2018\nIf you ask me, that's extreme and should it come to pass, then it's more than $100 billion down the drain. One of the reasons why they are so negative is the fluctuation of Bitcoin prices which contributes largely to their emphasis that Bitcoin is not store of value (SoV). Otherwise, Bitcoin meets all the other characteristics of money as an account of value and medium of exchange.\nPerhaps this is the reason why Tangem has solid reasons why they are p rinting smart Bitcoin banknotes in domination of 0.01 BTC and 0.05 BTC.\nIt's been the longest, richest, most sleepless week in our recent history — we finally launched limited pilot sales both offline and online, garnered 𝒾𝓃𝒸𝓇𝑒𝒹𝒾𝒷𝓁𝑒 demand from the whole world, and are now committed to grow across borders! You are all the very best!! pic.twitter.com/4NNm7Sunwj\n— Tangem (@TangemCash) May 11, 2018\nHard to shift and can't imagine transacting without \"feeling\" money? That's the solution for you and a spur for adoption maybe?\nBitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe follow through of week ending April 15 has been reversed and we are back within previous trading range within a consolidating market. Check out how the last six candlesticks are moving within a $2,200 range whose upper limits are at $10,000. If anything, that's a Sine curve with anchors at around $7800, our main support line in lower times.\nNow, here is the thing. We are interpreting these lower lows as short coverings with defining supports at April 22 lows, that's around $7,800. Therefore, if we get any hints of rejection of lower lows in lower time frame charts as the daily chart, then we can wait for confirmation and load in the direction of week ending April 15 bullish candlestick. After all, market participation is low as these decreasing volumes past the last three weeks show.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe reason why I'm positive and looking forward for Bitcoin upward trajectory? Well, it isn't hard to see that prices are building up from May 18 bear pressure rejection and a consequent spike in market participation. There, it's evident that despite the overall markets being bearish, there is a deal of buy pressure and thus the confirmation in the next two days to May 20. As it is, bears are driving prices lower but the last two candlesticks are still trending within May 20 bullish candlestick meaning there is more urge for upwards that downwards. Because of this, I will recommend looking for undervaluation in lower time frames and buying Bitcoin preferably at around $7,800 and $8000 or waiting for a break above$8,800 or May 20 highs.\nThe post Bitcoin Lead Developer Garvin Andresen Won't Do Public Interviews Anymore: Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis (May 23, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garvin andresen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin network", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T03:14:27.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85b397b05191caf2292fb0f8e72ffbd8ebcec5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0W4nuwiXj4GVQTiAGPwxo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "title_full": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "published": "2018-05-23T03:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85b397b05191caf2292fb0f8e72ffbd8ebcec5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0W4nuwiXj4GVQTiAGPwxo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptolandlords", "published": "2018-05-23T03:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "text": "wow that is a great Idea of studying btc in school, at least this will the student a basic understanding of how btc or blockchain is being manage and use I wasn't giving this medium to study btc in school", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T01:05:06.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61dc224a9ad93b0f6483b804b4a2b4a4e7455130", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPuB2_p9j49GZjwEQaircYKPcFskfvwp3bze68vGplXt9.Axi5MKcPekGzl_Wh_izEaatLcaFjSmMbjBHevYfe_Q-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

A little over a month after being subjected to a 51% attack, the network is once again at the mercy of a malevolent attacker who is rejecting blocks and profiting handsomely off the carnage caused. The repeat attack illustrates the risks faced by low hashrate Proof of Work coins. Verge Does a Verge Special The 51% attack in action\nOn the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected. The attack was spotted by the same individual who uncovered the previous attack in April. In a post on the Bitcointalk forum , “ocminer” wrote: “Since nothing really was done about the previous attacks (only a band-aid), the attackers now simply use two algos to fork the chain for their own use and are gaining millions”.\nThe entity responsible was coining in $1,000 a minute and is believed to have made $1.7 million already from the attack. Predictably, verge’s fans assigned the attacker’s motivations to “an act of hate” designed to FUD their altcoin. This theory gained short shrift on the Bitcointalk forum, with one commenter retorting: “Verge is being targeted because it has shitty coding and an incompetent developer. This hack is the result of the terrible job he did ‘patching’ the previous hack.” The original attack involved exploiting one of the five hashing algorithms verge uses (most cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin only use one). This time around the attacker is believed to have used two algos after renting power from a service such as Nicehash and then using it to find all the new blocks.\nFollowers of the official Verge Twitter account, meanwhile, will have had no idea why their coin is dumping, because the team doesn’t like to share bad news:\nAs understatements go, that tweet is right up there with the account’s previous one in relation to last month’s attack. Verge: Good for Porn, Bad for Everything Else\nVerge (XVG) has had a roller-coaster year to say the least. Despite pumping off the news of a major paid partnership, which transpired to be with Pornhub, it’s been rocked by mining attacks. As one redditor quipped on r/Cryptocurrency, the attacker “is securing his lifetime porn hub membership”. Only days ago, a Chinese agency ranked verge’s blockchain level with bitcoin itself, placing it joint 13th out of 28 cryptocurrencies.\nThe price of XVG has dropped significantly since the attack came to light, mirroring that of bitcoin gold, which was hit by an almost identical attack four days ago, leading to double spend attacks and forcing the BTG team to issue a warning to exchanges to be alert to large fraudulent deposits being made. Incidents such as these illustrate the difficulty of securing smaller PoW chains. It is not inconceivable that a time might arrive when only BTC, BCH, and a handful of other chains of note are secured by PoW, with lesser altcoins forced to migrate to Proof of Stake to mitigate 51% attacks.\nDo you think 51% attacks on lower hashrate coins are inevitable?

All major markets are still down, a trend which began forming yesterday morning. Things have not improved in the past 24 hours by any means. The Bitcoin Cash price illustrates that problem perfectly, as it is slowly dropping to $ 1,000. Bitcoin Cash Price Woes Worsen\nThere is very little to be excited about when it comes to cryptocurrency prices as of right now. With all markets down in the dirt, it is evident there is a fair amount of panic setting in. Traders and speculators are more than willing to part with their cryptocurrency holdings right now, which will only push the prices down even further. This is quite visible when looking at the Bitcoin Cash price as of right now.\nTo be more specific, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped from nearly $ 1,300 to $ 1,056 in the past few days. It is evident this is not the development most people are looking for these days, but there is very little to be done about it at this point in time. With the Bitcoin Cash price dropping 11.5% over the past 24 hours, the bigger question is whether or not the value can remain above $ 1,000 for much longer.\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin Cash price is also losing ground thanks to further declines in the BCH/BTC ratio. With another 6.61% decline in the past 24 hours, it is evident speculators are mainly interested in getting rid of BCH in favor of Bitcoin right now. This also applies to other cryptocurrencies as of right now, and it remains to be seen when the momentum turns in favor of the cryptocurrency industry.\nWith $ 696.16m in 24-hour trading volume , things are not looking all that bad for Bitcoin Cash. Although this volume isn’t the most impressive by any means, it is still pretty significant when looking at some of the other altcoins on the market. It also appears the total cryptocurrency trading volume is rising again, albeit this is mainly due to more people selling their holdings right now.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, Bitcoin Cash is extremely popular on OKex, Bitfinex, and HitBTC. LBank is also in the top five, and OKEx’s BTC pair closes out the top five. It is interesting to see so many markets generate over $ 30m in trading volume these past 24 hours. Unfortunately, there are only two fiat currency pairs in the entire top 10, which means less fresh capital is entering the BCH ecosystem as of right now.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen how things will unfold for the Bitcoin Cash price. It is evident the current momentum is not looking all that hot, but there is no reason to wallow in despair either. Cryptocurrencies are volatile by nature, and there are a lot of reasons as to why the Bitcoin Cash price is suffering from major setbacks right now. Whether or not it will remain above $ 1,000, is the big question for today, as that seems very difficult right now.

Customers Send Bitcoin Across The Border By Jeff Benson May 23, 2018 8:24 PM May 23, 2018 8:24 PM 0 LinkedIn Cancel Banco Masventas joins with an exchange, Bitex, to facilitate international payments in bitcoin. Argentina’s troubled economic history suggests customers will welcome the news.\nBanco Masventas, a bank in Argentina, will partner with Bitex, an Argentina-based exchange , to allow customers to send or receive bitcoin for international transactions instead of using the SWIFT network.\nThe bank announced the news Monday on its website . The announcement reads, in part: \" The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries.\" It also notes that account -to- account payments are available for \"more than 50 countries\" and can be completed within 24 hours.\nAlthough the transfers will be made in bitcoin, the partnership with Bitex allows the bank to quickly convert Argentine pesos into bitcoin and back to local currency. Customers, therefore, aren't dealing with bitcoin directly.\nBecause it's through a bank, it's not quite the anonymous – or even pseudonymous – system that privacy advocates might envision. To send to another account , customers must not only give bank details of the person they're sending to, but also provide proof of their own address and a copy of their ID. Moreover, they'll be charged an international transfer commission of 3 percent plus VAT (value added tax).\nYet given Argentina's history of economic problems, users may be happy to pay the fee. Journalist Nathaniel Popper wrote in 2015 about how Argentina's volatile financial system made it an ideal laboratory for bitcoin. The country's inflation rate stood above 25 percent last year and 40 percent the year before. Obviously, that's high compared to the rest of the world, where inflation hovers around 2 percent. And it may be enough to rattle customers who remember when inflation skyrocketed above 3,000 percent in the early '90s.\nOver the past few years, however, the country has reduced controls on currency exchanges. Those controls had hindered Argentinians' ability to easily exchange pesos for dollars without paying a hefty fee. Still, freer access to the US dollar isn't likely to reduce consumer demand for international payments in bitcoin, especially when those payments can be made quicker and cheaper. Argentina has generally been receptive to that cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology behind it. For example, the government has been publishing official bulletins on the Bitcoin blockchain since June 2017.\nTranslations by Google. Jeff Benson Jeff Benson is Managing Editor of ETHNews.

Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow “bitcoiner,” who then placed the order.\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then.

The currency is now trading for just over $7,600 – the lowest it’s been in about 35 days.\nThis marks a serious drop over the last two weeks. Just two weekends ago, the currency was trading for about $9,800 – the highest it had been in four weeks. As bitcoin was expected to spike to $10,000, many traders and investors alike sat with bated breath, hoping the currency would once again strike five figures and prove to the world it was not a fluke, and that its behavior during December of last year wasn’t just some random occurrence.\nSadly, bitcoin appears unable to show off for the time being. The currency has incurred serious drops ever since that weekend high, and even failed to garner major price boosts during last week’s Coindesk Consensus Conference, which even analyst Tom Lee of Fundstrat was surprised by. In the past, bitcoin has always rallied during these Conferences, so to witness the exact opposite behavior this year is not only frustrated and upsetting – it’s also concerning.\nWhy is bitcoin dropping to such a degree? Up to this point, the cryptocurrency has experienced falls of anywhere between $100 and $300 on a somewhat daily basis, all the while gaining a little traction here and there to slightly remedy the negative consequences. What could stir such a nasty, sudden and above all, large drop in such a short period?\nAt press time, most analysts appear to be of the sentiment that bitcoin is not only trapped in a bearish trend, but that it may last for some time. One source, for example, says that another sell-off is occurring – one comparable in size to the sell-off that occurred at the end of 2017. Indeed, bitcoin’s recent drop is a huge indicator that this practice has not yet passed on.\nUnfortunately, this same source suggests that bitcoin’s next support level sits at $7,200 – roughly $400 less than its current mark. From there, bitcoin could drop down to where it stood in March. The bearish trend we’re currently witnessing may not end until the currency falls to $6,000.\nAnother analyst is on the opposite side of the spectrum, and suggests that bitcoin support sits at $7,800. Thus, we could witness small price spikes in the coming days before any serious changes occur. He further states that bullish momentum is forming, and that bitcoin could potentially retrace its steps back to the $8,000 range.\nIn the meantime, some good things are still happening for the father of cryptocurrencies. Banco Masventas in Argentina, for example, has started a program that allows customers to make cross-border payments using bitcoin. The bank is looking to expand its services to as many as 50 separate countries.\nIn addition, executives say that customers can look forward to the bank’s rapid transaction speeds of less than 24 hours. This is a major milestone for bitcoin, which is noted for its slow transaction periods of roughly one to three days on average. Banco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to handle international fund transfers using BTC as a base currency.

What exactly does that mean? Can it be another challenge for the entrepreneur to cope with along with everything else? Can it be another chance? If so, you may ask: \"How do I find out about it, utilize it, without becoming lost in the crypto-mathematical formulae?\"\nBlockchain is the technology which supports the usage of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that's making central banks and authorities worried, and it's correct that the latter aren't sure whether to prohibit bitcoin, or adopt it, or expect it'll evaporate as a different ephemeral hype. However, blockchain is now over the technology which guarantees the credibility of bitcoin. It did begin this way, but it's acquired new applications, started new opportunities and charted new vistas.\nLet us begin with the flames, which constantly fascinate as they appear to tell the source of this thought, the first considering the spark of genius, until the creation requires a life of its own and yells to an infinity of applications. In other words, bitcoin is an electronic currency setup to work with a central bank or thing to control it. The trades are supported by nodal points spread within a network of computers known as \"miners,\" with crypto-mathematical formulations, which solved will make it possible for the \"miners\" to acquire more bitcoins. In only a couple of words, people (using computers) solve complicated mathematical questions to confirm the money, and are associated with one another through a bonded and unchangeable series of cubes, making tampering with the credibility of the currency nearly impossible.\nThe machine, which was assembled with someone or a group of individuals called Satoshi Nakamoto from 2008 to maintain and protected bitcoin, is blockchain. The cubes in blockchain are knots containing encrypted data, in addition to a reference to the date of this production, as well as the title of the former block to the present block is connected in a chained way. Any change to this series won't overwrite the present data, but will probably be inserted as a new block, even once it's been supported by the rest of the blocks in the system.\nHowever there was still another start. As in all starts, the start keeps breakout because with revolutionary notions, such as blockchain, there's absolutely no ideal start- actually, all starts are perfect (or imperfect) in their own manner. \"Smart contracts\" obtained a kickstart after the maturation of blockchain technologies a couple of years after.\nIs not this \"tech hype,\" as evanescent as the several daydreams about flying automobiles, medical labs onto your smart phone, or microchips cleansing your system out of cells that are malevolent? Future Thinkers do not believe so: in actuality, they've compiled a record of approximately 19 businesses that blockchain will interrupt. All those sectors is already seeing various applications of technologies by burgeoning startups which attempt to innovate, or become aggressive, or enhance how things are done up to now. The ring is widening day from the day, and just couple of years after the start, it is not about bitcoin merely ahead.\nEntrepreneurs need a reply to these questions: \"What's it inside for me? Why should I utilize blockchain technology?\" It's distributed (decentralized) and consequently non-regulated with a central entity, which may be in the mercy of governmental or other factors. And what if entrepreneurs and authorities do to get ready for or make the most of blockchain? It is correct that there's a good deal of hype regarding blockchain, but the reality is that some businesses are already feeling that the shift. The savvy entrepreneur ought to jump onto the bandwagon, as opposed to wait and watch.\nPrimarily, governments should realize that blockchain technology can bring a set of chances with respect to storing information, contracts, names, and official records.\nEntrepreneurs must also be prepared to get involved and see that a chance to perform better, decrease cost, and also be successful. Banks and financial institutions may use it in order to accelerate transactions; cybersecurity companies could require the participatory and cryptographic facets to guarantee improved security and protection; participatory transportation can, together with blockchain, operate without middlemen; startups in this field might help setup systems which become autonomous when the consumers become knowledgeable about how to utilize it; supply of electricity could cut the massive cost linked to supply and centralized direction. Therefore, small companies and cooperatives may be made to educate and educate users about the best way best to purchase from manufacturers and distribute to customers.\nBlockchain is a not a new monster at the event, nor a fad that will deflate until we understand it. It's a severe technological advancement that will revolutionize numerous businesses, given entrepreneurs and governments invest in it today, before it becomes a fact that occupies itself when others will have already reaped the advantage of being leaders. And that fact will dawn on everybody shortly- probably sooner than we all think.

This announcement came just days after hacked Japanese exchange Coincheck confirmed the delisting of privacy coins.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Farewell to Five Cryptocurrencies\nKorbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced this week that it will be delisting the cryptocurrencies currently offered through its Other Digital Assets service.\n“We will bid farewell to the Other Digital Assets service through a gradual termination of the buy and sell functions for the following coins,” Korbit wrote, adding that the affected coins are dash (DASH), monero (XMR), zcash (ZEC), augur (REP), and steem (STEEM).\nThis service gives Korbit users access to the above five cryptocurrencies in addition to those regularly supported by the exchange: BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ETC, LTC, and BTG.\nFor the five affected cryptocurrencies, Korbit emphasized that the buy functionality will be terminated “After 15:00 on 05/28/2018” and the sell functionality “After 15:00 on 06/21/2018.” However, the exchange hinted at the possibility of re-listing some of them at a later date, elaborating:\nWe strive to facilitate secure trades of more cryptocurrencies, but we have yet to determine the date for resumption of trades of the affected coins. We thus advise you to protect your interests by either selling or withdrawing the said cryptocurrencies. Reason for Termination\nKorbit’s announcement does not give the reason why the five cryptocurrencies are being dropped other than stating, “We are fully committed to building the most secure place for you to trade cryptocurrencies.”\nFurthermore, there have been no reports of the South Korean regulators pressuring crypto exchanges to drop privacy coins, unlike the Japanese regulator .\nSince Coincheck was hacked in January, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has strengthened oversight of crypto exchanges including setting new criteria for their registration. One of them concerns the types of cryptocurrencies listed. “Those granting a high level of anonymity and easily used for money laundering will as a general rule be banned,” Nikkei reported.\nSubsequently, Coincheck announced just days before Korbit that it is dropping DASH, XMR, ZEC, and REP after it received a business improvement order from the agency. STEEM is not listed on Coincheck.\nThe reason Korbit is dropping STEEM may be related to a notice the exchange posted on May 8, stating:\nDue to external issues, STEEM withdrawals are being suspended indefinitely.\nWhat do you think of Korbit dropping these cryptocurrencies?

Now you can pay for your flight and accommodation with Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nThe decision to adopt Bitcoin for the first time was implemented in 2013. Thus, the travel agency has become the world’s first company in this domain to accept cryptocurrency. From now on, the company moves with quick steps towards its development and adaptation to market demands, announcing the expansion of payment services with three more altcoins.\n“ Right now we are in the early stages, but at CheapAir.com we see a future where travellers and travel companies are more accepting of digital currencies, and one where blockchain technologies play a larger role in payments from consumers and with our business partners ,” claimed Jeff Klee, CEO, and founder of CheapAir.com. LTC, DASH, and BCH are more advanced than BTC\nBearing in mind that Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, it doesn’t mean that its network isn’t experiencing problems. Among them, we find scalability, volatility, and long transaction times. Given these issues, the travel agency has turned its attention to other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Dash and Bitcoin Cash, all of which have more advanced properties than Bitcoin does.\n“ Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much,” stated Klee. “Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested .”\nAccording to Klee, it’s a challenge to accept virtual coins, especially for travel companies. According to Klee, CheapAir “ had the plumbing in place to make digital currency payments work seamlessly for our customers and suppliers .”\n“ That made adding Litecoin, bitcoin cash, and Dash a relatively minor endeavour for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers ,” he concluded.\nWe want to remind you that in April 2018, the company announced the change of its BTC payment processor. Thus, the crypto exchange Coinbase couldn’t continue to support the company’s operations.

He touched on their complexity and the fact that they are connected with a yearning for social revolution.\nRobert Shiller is an esteemed Nobel prize winning economist who is known for his warnings about the dot-com and the housing bubbles. In an interview for CNBC, the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying:\nTo me it’s another example of faddish human behavior.\nShiller’s opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also consolidated in a blog post that he published on May 21 st . Apples and Oranges\nShiller lays down his take on cryptocurrencies, bringing forward what he believes are comparable examples of other failed attempts to replace conventional fiat currency.\nHe touches the so-called Labor Theory of Value , as well as John Pease Norton’s proposition of introducing a dollar, the value of which was backed by electricity. Both of those examples attempted to replace the gold standard, which, for the US, meant that 40% of its notes had to be backed by gold . This ended in 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard, severing the connection between gold and the dollar.\nAs it is painfully obvious, both those examples proposed new models during an existing, pre-determined standard. They attempted to disrupt what was currently existing and replace it with something new – money backed by labor and electricity, respectively, and not by gold, which was the merit at the time these propositions came to light. As Shiller notes:\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\nBitcoin , on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution!\nApparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nLet’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Up until this moment, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government.\nAnother leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin . While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he touched that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000!\nAs it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it?\nAs a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan , Facebook , LG , Microsoft , Oracle , HTC , and many more.\nEven the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay.\nYet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment:\nPractically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\nIt’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.\nDo you agree with Professor Shiller that Bitcoin’s mysterious glamor is all there is to it?

This could put it on track towards testing the range floor at the $6,550 level. Technical indicators are confirming that selling pressure is still in play.\nBitcoin price seems poised for more losses as it reeled from Kashkari’s remarks and is setting its sights on the range bottom.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse.\nThe 100 SMA also seems to have held as dynamic resistance and would likely keep further gains in check in another pullback. The gap between the two moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure.\nRSI is pointing down to confirm that sellers are in control and could further weigh on bitcoin price. Similarly stochastic is on the move down to show that bearish momentum is present. In that case, bitcoin price could make it all the way down to the bottom of the range.\nHowever, both oscillators are also nearing oversold conditions to reflect bearish exhaustion. If buyers return as the oscillators pull up, the middle of the range could attract some buyers and lead to a bounce back to the top. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nFOMC member Neel Kashkari had some negative remarks on the cryptocurrency industry this week, and the lack of positive catalysts left these altcoins vulnerable to selling pressure. He noted:\nIt’s a clever idea that some people came up with, but now it’s being taken to ridiculous extremes. The barrier to entry to creating a new cryptocurrency is zero.\nFurthermore Kashkari mentioned:\nIf you can dupe enough people to buy it, you can pretend that you’ve launched something. And you can say, ‘Look, I’m a billionaire because I sold you one. And I own the other 999 million of them, so that means I’m a billionaire! So it has become a farce…I’m seeing more noise and more fraud than I’m seeing anything useful.

Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, he predicted in a tweet. Meanwhile, a new study has shown that the mood of investors, rather than economic indicators, actually determines the value of cryptocurrencies. Also, do you want to know when Paypal will support crypto payments?\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics Institutional Investors to Pump Billions in Crypto\nJohn McAfee expects a bull run on cryptocurrency markets in the near future. Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert predicted in a post on the microblogging platform Twitter this week. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said in his tweet . He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads.\nMcAfee was probably referring to several recent announcements indicating possible developments in that direction. Earlier this month, reports suggested that Goldman Sachs is going to launch a bitcoin trading operation to buy and sell bitcoin futures on behalf of institutional clients. More recently, US crypto exchange Coinbase announced new services meant to attract big money players such as crypto hedge funds. The plans include the launch of a crypto custodian service and a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions called Coinbase Prime. The San Francisco-based company has also discussed with regulators the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nHowever, McAfee’s optimistic prognosis coincides with the return of the bears to the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has just dropped below the $8,000 mark, hitting a month’s low. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at over $1,000 (at the time of writing). John McAfee has previously predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million USD by the end of 2020. Study: Investors’ Mood Determines the Value of Cryptocurrencies\nAccording to a new study published by Warwick Business School, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined primarily by the mood of investors and not so much by economic factors or indicators. Assistant professor of finance Daniele Bianchi has found that the price patterns of the 14 largest cryptocurrencies reflect past returns of investors, combined with the hype and emotion experienced as they watch the value climb or fall. The research is titled “Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class: An Empirical Assessment,” the Independent reports.\nAccording to the author, this behavior can be attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall outside the remit of governments or financial institutions. Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, he notes. Bianchi also points out that the study shows limited similarities between bitcoin and gold. At the same time, because of the high volatility of the prices of the biggest cryptocurrencies, they can hardly be seen as a reliable savings instrument. CFO: If Bitcoin Gets ‘Better’, Paypal Will Support It\nJohn Rainey, the Chief Financial Officer of Paypal, has stated in a recent interview that the payment platform will proceed with a bit more caution towards cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he admitted that if cryptocurrency stabilizes in the future and becomes “better currency”, his company will “certainly support that”. Rainey added that the volatile crypto swings threaten the viability of the businesses Paypal is working with.\n“If you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” Paypal CFO told CNBC . “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that,” Rainey elaborated.\nDespite Paypal’s current position on cryptocurrencies, a recent patent filing revealed that the payment provider might be considering expanding its exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Reports came out in March this year that Paypal has filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an “expedited virtual currency transaction system”. Back in 2016, it was reported that the company had applied for another crypto-related patent – one that envisages the development of a payment module accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price dropped by around 4 percent from $8,300 to $7,850. Bitcoin Price Trend\nAs CCN previously reported , the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to three major factors: Mt. Gox sell-off in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy, and scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb.\nThese three factors led investors to lose confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. By targeting a small portion of their user base to forfeit tax IDs and personal identification, Bitfinex led large-scale investors to become fearful of a potential government intervention and withdrew big sums of funds from the exchange.\nIn South Korea, due to the controversy surrounding UPbit and Bithumb, local investors have become bewildered, not knowing whether the local cryptocurrency market can be trusted or not.\nDespite the drastic improvement in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency industry and the entrance of major financial institutions, the overly strong downtrend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies have disallowed the market to rebound and initiate a corrective rally.\nIt is likely that in the short-term, the BTC price drops to the lower end of $7,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo suggested on May 22.\n“Pretty sure $8,000 support on BTCUSD is gonna fail. Next support, low $7,000s (though that could fail too). Then I’m expecting another dead kitten taking us into July – September period when BTC unwinds completely from mania phase and is ready for an accumulation phase,” said Woo.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin has already started to show oversold conditions, which would normally result in a strong rebound for BTC. But, due to the strong downtrend of the bitcoin price, the low RSI of bitcoin will likely be dismissed and bears will continue to push the price to the lower end of $7,000.\nBitcoin has successfully minimized its downtrend at the $7,700 mark, recording a slight bounce back to $7,850. However, if the bitcoin price declines below $7,700, it is likely that the bitcoin price stabilizes in the $7,300 region in the short-term. Tokens\nIn the cryptocurrency market, trading tokens is similar to leverage trading, because tokens often increase or decline in value by larger margins in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies.\nOntology, Aelf, ICON, 0x, Decentraland, Ziliqa, and AirSwap, all of which have recorded over 20 percent gains against bitcoin over the past week, have recorded losses in the range of 4 to 12 percent against bitcoin and 8 to 16 percent against the US dollar.\nIf the BTC price fails to rebound to the $8,000 region and remains in the lower end of $7,000 throughout this week, it is highly likely that tokens will continue to drop against both bitcoin and US dollar.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:17:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ab2354cc4480223a57b37e413f05d241b98a3c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7rn_n2HEDTegBs92yapEbWl_.eveUxJcWSwRY0DRW6P4CDRtF_IWk6D5LOL.n6i7F3wU19iYbEaqiYpxs1QOHWFiI_Iv.x2kXo.GngulC8GRpO8z7Lex.", "site_full": "qz.com", "site": "qz.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Almost half of cryptocurrency and bitcoin bros identify as libertarian — Quartz", "title_full": "Almost half of cryptocurrency and bitcoin bros identify as libertarian — Quartz", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/venn-diagram-crypto-and-libertarian3.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1461, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 213, "comments": 0, "shares": 213}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ab2354cc4480223a57b37e413f05d241b98a3c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7rn_n2HEDTegBs92yapEbWl_.eveUxJcWSwRY0DRW6P4CDRtF_IWk6D5LOL.n6i7F3wU19iYbEaqiYpxs1QOHWFiI_Iv.x2kXo.GngulC8GRpO8z7Lex.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Georgia Frances King", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Almost half of cryptocurrency and bitcoin bros identify as libertarian — Quartz", "text": "No hard fork here. (Daniel Lee for Quartz) Share Georgia Frances King May 23, 2018\nLibertarians believe that the government should have minimal interference in the lives and finances of its citizens. The cryptocurrency community believes in a monetary system free from centralized oversight, with decisions driven by the masses rather than regulators.\nSame difference, right?\nLibertarians and crypto enthusiasts have some serious overlap, as first brought to my attention by Kate O’Neill , a human-centric tech strategist.\nBoth are overrepresented by white dudes partial to ostentatious displays of wealth , among other things. It’s no wonder, then, that the libertarian “ hippies of the right ” and some corners of the crypto community have become chummy. They make great bedfellows.\nOnce firmly on the fringe, both libertarians and cypherpunks are having a moment. According to a recent study, more than 44% of bitcoin holders call themselves libertarian . Meanwhile, around 10% of Americans now identify as libertarian , and the 2016 US presidential election had the largest Libertarian Party turnout in history, with 3.3% of the vote . Core tenets\nFrom its inception, bitcoin has had libertarian connotations. “It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” wrote Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s anonymous creator, in 2008. Likewise, blockchain, the decentralized system on which cryptocurrencies are built, is in its nature a libertarian construct: It does away with the need for an intermediary in transactions, allowing people to have complete control of their assets.\nIn other words, individual liberty is a core tenet of both groups.\nThere’s even talk of starting a country they could tie it all together, as part of a plan dubbed Free Society . This proposed utopia announced by Olivier Janssens and Roger Ver in 2017 would “establish a rule of law based on libertarian principles and free markets.” The seed funding for the purchase of land is coming mostly from the crypto classes , with $100 million reportedly already in the bank. The two founders reportedly hold some 200,000 bitcoins between them, which would equate to roughly $1.5 billion at today’s rates. “Dying with a pile of money isn’t any fun, so let’s make the world a better place,” Ver told Bitcoin magazine .\nWhat would a crypto-libertarian world be like? Both communities feature their fair share of paradoxes. For example, libertarians’ desire for radical freedom from government intervention make them generally pro-choice on abortion and also in favor of few restrictions on gun ownership . Likewise, cryptocurrency’s privacy-minded nature gives users the ability to conduct trade anonymously, which has helped black markets flourish for a range of illicit activities. Cast of characters\nCrypto-holding libertarians can count some illustrious names in their mix. Julian Assange , the founder of Wikileaks, which accepts bitcoin donations, says his group has made a 50,000% return on its crypto holdings. Jimmy Wales , the co-founder of Wikipedia, started buying bitcoin in 2014. My deepest thanks to the US government, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCard, Payal, AmEx, Mooneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin — with > 50000% return. pic.twitter.com/9i8D69yxLC\n— Julian Assange (tweets by #FreeJulian campaign)⌛ (@JulianAssange) October 14, 2017 Playing with BTC today: I just bought 0.1 bitcoin with @Coinbase ! https://t.co/rU2JBWB2AB\n— Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) March 6, 2014\nAnd then, of course, there’s Peter Thiel.\nThe Paypal and Palantir cofounder is a self-identified libertarian , despite his recent association with Donald Trump. As he wrote in a blog post for the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank:\nI remain committed to the faith of my teenage years: to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good. I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives, and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual. For all these reasons, I still call myself “libertarian.” But I must confess that over the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\nImmortality-mongering aside—Thiel really , really wants to live forever—this could be read as a mission statement for the foundations of cryptocurrency: an economic utopia that celebrates the individual. “Crypto is libertarian, AI is communist,” he said in a recent debate with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. (Hoffman countered that cryptocurrencies are “anarchy” and artificial intelligence is “the rule of law.”) Thiel has said that bitcoin will be the “ online equivalent to gold ” and has been stocking up since 2012 , when the price of the original cryptocurrency was a fraction of what it is today.\nWhere to from here? Because of the individualist nature of both communities, it’s a little hard to tell. When wealth and power become untangled from central oversight, and people are free to roam as they please, it comes down to the principles of the individuals pushing their doctrines forward. “Bitcoin is an open source protocol with no ideology, and only people hold these types of values,” writes Jamie Redman in Bitcoin News . “So, in the end, the choice of what bitcoin will ultimately disrupt will be in the hands of the users.”\nSee you in Free Society ?\nThis story is a part of Quartz Ideas , our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.

When bitcoin was trading at around $8,000 on Tuesday, Lee appeared on CNBC's \"Futures Now \" saying the digital currency was actually \"trading at cost\" because the price of production was actually about that amount. Despite the plunge, Lee also wrote to CNBC that the cost of production for bitcoin on Wednesday was at around $6,000, meaning that in Lee's eyes, bitcoin is still actually worth more than its cost of production.\nBut among the big catalysts that will boost the crypto space, Lee is keeping an eye on institutional investors.\n\"I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,\" he said on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.\"\nAnd finally, data compiled by Fundstrat show a historical trend that has Lee encouraging investors to hold onto bitcoin.\n\"Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin's price,\" he said. \"If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin's down 25 percent a year.\"\n\"So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days,\" he added.\nWith Wednesday's drop, bitcoin is now down 41 percent this year.\nVote\nshow chapters Bitcoin's falling, but Fundstrat's Tom Lee stands by bull case for cryptocurrency 4:24 PM ET Tue, 22 May 2018 | 06:31 Disclaimer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:20:09.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21a39bcfb4b0dcdcccef20dd3e4aba58e05977da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9r4wcDioQY6cCEGgSOCeHIb9n4k9SEvP9iOkYu7yJt6bDSSvp7d1zyzj1kR_34jUAzMlLtUJQKrWbfTDMkgmgIVmY6nBqLH4cbDV1zeaiVzLFLsKhn1lTEDqjblzoO0bcRXe69QdbMQbACfyxDBTJ0", "site_full": "www.cbs8.com", "site": "cbs8.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin scams growing in popularity with a high risk of ICO and - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8", "title_full": "Bitcoin scams growing in popularity with a high risk of ICO and - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21a39bcfb4b0dcdcccef20dd3e4aba58e05977da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9r4wcDioQY6cCEGgSOCeHIb9n4k9SEvP9iOkYu7yJt6bDSSvp7d1zyzj1kR_34jUAzMlLtUJQKrWbfTDMkgmgIVmY6nBqLH4cbDV1zeaiVzLFLsKhn1lTEDqjblzoO0bcRXe69QdbMQbACfyxDBTJ0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Susan Tompor", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin scams growing in popularity with a high risk of ICO and - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8", "text": "Bitcoin scams growing in popularity with a high risk of ICO and - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8 Member Center: Bitcoin scams growing in popularity with a high risk of ICO and cryptocurrency fraud Posted: Video\nA crackdown on cryptocurrency-related scams is being coordinated by state regulators across the country as con artists play up the popularity of Bitcoin.\nVarious enforcement actions, including some taken in provinces of Canada, have included cease and desist orders involving companies with names like Cryptocashback, Cryptosecure, DasCoin, ThinkCoin, Ubcoin, Leverage and Krios.\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association - a group of state securities regulators who work to protect investors - said Monday that 70 investigations have opened up relating to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency programs. There are 35 pending and completed enforcement actions nationwide since the beginning of May.\nMillennials are viewed as potential targets, as are consumers who are embracing products related to financial technology, or fintech.\nRegulators said Millennials are both most likely to use fintech products (84%) and most at risk of fraud relating to some fintech schemes (41%), according to a survey released by the North American Securities Administrators Association in February.\nICOs and cryptocurrencies are viewed as high risks for fraud.\nInitial coin offerings are fund-raising programs that could be used to kick off a new cryptocurrency effort. But some of the ICOs can be nothing but frauds where con artists keep the cash.\nMore: Cope with soaring gas prices: Avoid these cars, SUVs with the worst fuel economy\nEven offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky.\n\"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" said Joe Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.\nWhy are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs?\n\"People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,\" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C.\nMany times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director.\nSome consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money - even using digital currency - on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns.\nRegulators said \"Operation Cryptosweep\" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers.\nBitcoin - which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 - rose above $19,000 by December.\nBitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build.\nIn some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements.\nJoe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money.\nOne fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency.\nSome signs of a scam: Promoters promise lucrative returns tied to cryptocurrencies but manipulate photographs, possibly using stock photos available elsewhere online, in seemingly professional, polished presentations online.\nChristopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes.\nGerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments.\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin only exists due to its revolutionary blockchain technology which creates a self-contained giant ledger keeping track of all transactions with 100% accuracy and without a third party. In the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin Cash has become a highly sought-after digital currency over the past few months and seems to be gaining support and momentum all the time.\nMany people have used the peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the recent past, the Bitcoin Cash network has managed to accumulate a massive amount of support and infrastructure. Features of Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash has a much larger block size (8MB) than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a different transaction signature as well as wipeout and replay protection. If the hash rate is low, Bitcoin Cash can quickly adjust the difficulty of its proof-of-work. Bitcoin Cash network fees are cheaper than those of most other blockchain networks. Moreover, the BCH network fees seem to be consistent, and they may remain low when the network upgrades to a 32MB block size. Hence, there will be plenty of room for cheap transactions. There is no need for BCH network users to rely on privacy-invasive techniques like transaction batching. Issues with Bitcoin’s Technology\nCompared to banks and credit card transactions, Bitcoin’s technology is said to be very slow, as it can process only seven transactions each second. Over 150 million transactions are handled by Visa every day, which is roughly equivalent to 1,700 transactions per second.\nBitcoin needs to scale and increase the speed of its transaction verification process, which is considered a central problem. There’s a solution to this problem. Either the amount of data verified in each block should be made smaller, or the blocks of data should be made larger. Transactions would thus be made cheaper and faster, and more transactions would be processed at one time. Differing Transaction fees\nBitcoin’s transaction capacity is limited by its high fees, as a user’s transaction won’t be processed until he or she pays for it to go through. Otherwise, the transaction may get stuck for months, which is nothing short of frustrating for all parties involved.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Cash, this unbearable situation is not present. There’s plenty of space in the blocks, which assures that transaction fees are always low and there’s no chance of users’ digital assets being in limbo for long periods of time.\nBitcoin Cash has a long way to go before overtaking Bitcoin, but it’s well on its way. When and if it ever does, it will likely lose its stigma as a fork and be considered the real Bitcoin. Perhaps one day it might even be referred to as just cash.\nFull details at themerkle.com/can-bitcoin-cash-take-out-bitcoin/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:23:04.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b821d9ad0529e195a581991575a3452438ad882c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTknsVNTRYd5eutapDiPxfMYdt9Ugw1OKb1bBMZP3EizEZbHOW6QvEWK6YceiMJi3cLqwZtnYm7V_AFhpGz1_xTExkUdtTy4o1e8bMnaitd6dEy2PzarPQJ", "site_full": "ethereumworldnews.com", "site": "ethereumworldnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "DAOstack Token Sale Sells Out; Project Looks Toward Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "DAOstack Token Sale Sells Out; Project Looks Toward Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dao-social-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b821d9ad0529e195a581991575a3452438ad882c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTknsVNTRYd5eutapDiPxfMYdt9Ugw1OKb1bBMZP3EizEZbHOW6QvEWK6YceiMJi3cLqwZtnYm7V_AFhpGz1_xTExkUdtTy4o1e8bMnaitd6dEy2PzarPQJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "DAOstack Token Sale Sells Out; Project Looks Toward Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "May 23, 2018 | Ethereum World News | Shares: 1\nThe token sale for GEN, the native utility token of the DAOstack ecosystem, successfully concluded on May 8 with a rapid sell-out of its main sale.

The move would make the Hackney mosque the first in the U.K. to take payments in digital currency. Mosque’s Chairman: “It’s New Money, It’s Moving with the Times”\nThe chairman of the Shacklewell Lane Mosque told the U.K.’s news publication i about the move to accept both Bitcoin and Ether for donations. According to 51-year-old Erkin Guney, these contributions would be spent on structural repair work at the mosque, helping poor members of the community with funeral costs, and feeding less well-off Muslim families. He said:\n“It’s new money. It’s moving with the times. It’s no different from transferring money from the bank.”\nThe mosque’s leaders have been advised about how the intricacies of using digital currency work by the founder of Combo Innovation, Gurmit Singh. Islamic finance is the focus of the London-based blockchain technology company.\nGuney went on to speak to the publication about the religious contributions Muslims make towards their community. These are known as Zakat:\n“The total market cap on cryptocurrencies is £290bn, with Bitcoin accounting for £104bn. If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1% of Bitcoins, or £1.04bn, then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due… It’s likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency. They are potentially losing out on millions of pounds.”\nHowever, some may remember earlier reports NewsBTC have penned about various Islamic nations discussing internally whether or not cryptocurrency should be deemed as being halal (permissible) or not. At the start of the year, the Mufti of Egypt expressed his feeling that Islam forbade the financial innovation. He stated:\n“…it is a cryptographic form of money that is vague and gives namelessness to crooks.”\nDespite this, a religious adviser to the mosque stated that these claims were unfounded. Zayd al Khair said that people spoke in a similar way about paper money when they initially moved from a gold-based economy. He went on to state in a meeting held Monday that he felt other mosques would soon open up to accepting cryptocurrency payments too.\n“Any money or currency is neither halal – permissible – nor haram – impermissible. Guidance is about the value which it represents. If money is transacted in a lawful manner then it is halal.

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around.\nRevolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough Nobel Prize Laureate Robert J. Shiller\nAfter reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\n“And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded.\nWhether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nWhat should the bitcoin community make of the professor’s observations?

This chart pattern spans 1.8000 to 2.6000 so the resulting selloff could last by 0.8000.\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the downtrend is more likely to continue than to reverse. The gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum.\nRSI is on the move down so IOTA could follow suit while sellers have the upper hand. However, this oscillator is dipping into oversold territory to reflect exhaustion among sellers. Stochastic is also indicating oversold conditions and turning higher could bring buyers back in.\nThere have been no major updates in the cryptocurrency industry recently, although it’s worth noting that FOMC member Kashkari had another set of negative remarks. In particular, he mentioned:\nIt’s a clever idea that some people came up with, but now it’s being taken to ridiculous extremes. The barrier to entry to creating a new cryptocurrency is zero.\nHe even called ICOs a farce, citing:\nIf you can dupe enough people to buy it, you can pretend that you’ve launched something. And you can say, ‘Look, I’m a billionaire because I sold you one. And I own the other 999 million of them, so that means I’m a billionaire! So it has become a farce…I’m seeing more noise and more fraud than I’m seeing anything useful.\nIn the absence of any positive developments in the industry over the past few weeks, IOTA and its peers were more vulnerable to these remarks than usual. Besides, the pickup in risk aversion on account of resurfacing geopolitical tensions also weighed on these riskier assets.\nLooking ahead, the FOMC minutes might be the next catalyst, unless there are other factors that could move the altcoins specifically.

Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow “bitcoiner,” who then placed the order.\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then.

Altcoin mining pool operator Suprnova revealed that an individual or an organization has invalidated legitimate blocks. Verge Attack\n“Verge is once again under attack, someone is 51%’ing the chain and invalidating all legit blocks. All pools and miners suffer from this, the attacker is getting all blocks currently,” said Suprnova.\nAccording to ocminer, the attacked gained two mining algorithms known as scrypt and lyra2re with almost no difficulty and utilized fake timestamps to trick the network. Consequently, the attacker has been able to invalidate many legitimate blocks and take over the network. Within a few hour span, the attacker gained more than $1.75 million, approximately 35 million XVG.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the attack can be described as a 51% attack given that the attacker did not have to gain 51 percent of the Verge network’s computing power to steal millions of dollars worth of XVG.\nSome members of the Verge community claimed that it was a time warp modified vector attack, which is a vulnerability that needs to be addressed by the Verge development team in the near future to prevent similar attacks. Describing the case as a time warp vector attack would make more sense, as the attack was able to gain control over the network with virtually no difficulty. Impossible With Bitcoin\nRecently, the Chinese government released its public blockchain rankings and ranked Verge and Bitcoin at number 13. The ranking of bitcoin, the most robust blockchain network with the longest track record at 13 with Verge outraged the bitcoin community. Bitcoin is highly unlikely to suffer the same fate.\nThe core difference between bitcoin and other altcoins and smaller blockchain networks as explained by security expert and bitcoin researcher Andreas Antonopoulos is that bitcoin’s computing power eliminates the possibility of 51 percent attacks. While state-sponsored attacks could be possible with billions of dollars in resources, it is highly unlikely and can be dealt with ease.\nAntonopoulos explained:\n“I don’t worry about that [51% attack on bitcoin] at all. This cannot be done with bitcoin anymore. This is something that could only be done with nascent altcoins. Bitcoin has achieved a level of computing that no single nation-state can overthrow it with computation alone.

There are two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently moving higher, but it is likely to face a strong selling interest just below $8,000.\nBitcoin price nosedived towards $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600.\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:22:35.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbc7f6536efcc9fff70774d08dc7afb4ce5e1789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBO_OVGCf7HHimbYkmZFkDOL1hkXho5Are58KrXPrkMR3t0qCDNZqP5byNWYZ.WlZGrqbU.dwBBVS1eDoc26HvKCqZMec9W4JOBLcX1slKVivDXcj9utF4UkT4BHTV7zQrrUp3On5.d3u8-", "site_full": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Elite Confirmed for CryptoCompare & MJAC London Blockchain Summit | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Elite Confirmed for CryptoCompare & MJAC London Blockchain Summit | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1521202619_Press-Release-Conferences.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbc7f6536efcc9fff70774d08dc7afb4ce5e1789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBO_OVGCf7HHimbYkmZFkDOL1hkXho5Are58KrXPrkMR3t0qCDNZqP5byNWYZ.WlZGrqbU.dwBBVS1eDoc26HvKCqZMec9W4JOBLcX1slKVivDXcj9utF4UkT4BHTV7zQrrUp3On5.d3u8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Elite Confirmed for CryptoCompare & MJAC London Blockchain Summit | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Elite Confirmed for CryptoCompare & MJAC London Blockchain Summit May 23, 2018 | Bitcoins Channel | Shares: 1\n– Coinfloor, Coinbase, Ripple, Citi, VanEck, Circle, BlockEx, EY (Ernst & Young LLP) and BP Prime amongst participants – MJAC announces the latest details for the CryptoCompare & MJAC London Blockchain Summit on June 13.

What are the differences? : btc", "text": "by MrCryptoDude\nThere’s is much debate amongst the community regarding Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Which blockchain is better? Which one is superior? Seems to be the question at hand. A close look into community arguments rises what looks to be an ideological battle with memes and insults used as primary weapons. Comment threads often devolve into chaos with no useful information being presented at all and it leaves newcomers ignorant to the situation.\nSo what are the actually differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash? Let’s take a definitive look at both blockchains to shed some light on this argument. The Scaling Debate\nThe scaling debate is an issue at the heart of the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash controversy. The question of how to properly scale the network to handle ever increase demand is a challenging one, and the community is working hard to solve these issues. To give you some perspective, Visa claims their systems are capable of processing 65,000 transactions messages per second at capacity. Bitcoin on the other hand, currently, can handle a maximum of 10 transactions per-second , and Bitcoin Cash, 213tx/s . Transactions per-second is primarily determined by the blockchains block size. Because Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size of 32MB (compared to Bitcoins 1 - 4MB size), BCH is able to processes more transactions and at a lower fee, than BTC.\nSo does this mean Bitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin? Not necessarily, the Bitcoin network has another trick up its sleeve called the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer solution to the scaling issues Bitcoin is facing. In a nutshell, the way it works is a payment channel is opened between sender and receiver. Think of it as a tab between sender and receiver. Through this tab, payments would be extremely fast, secure, and lower fees. Only when the payment channel closes will the balance of the tabs be recorded on the blockchain, and users subjugated to BTC's fees. This is the goal of the Lightning Network, and I say goal because it is not yet completed and still in beta .\nVisa on the other hand completely outclasses Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. How are these two suppose to scale to these lengths? Bitcoin Cash will just keep increasing its block size, so over time, 32MB per block may become 64MB, 128MB, 1G, etc… Bitcoin’s solution to the problem is the Lightning Network which is still in development. Why doesn’t Bitcoin want to increase its block size?\nThe BTC community does not want to increase block size for ideological reasons. The BTC communities belief is that anyone should be able to run a full validator node, and if the average joe is unable to do this, it hurts the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.\nA BCH supporter would argue that while yes, increased block sizes means increased storage requirements to support full nodes, this is irrelevant because storages prices continue to decrease every year and we should have no problem keeping up with ever increasing block size demand. Conclusions\nRight now, there is a good argument to be made as to why Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin. When you take into account transaction speed and scalability, it is clear that BCH has the upper hand. However, let me emphasize that because BCH currently has the upper hand DOES NOT mean it always will. Understand that these blockchains are still largely in development and a lot can happen in the upcoming years. It is very possible the Lightning Network will be of exceptional use and be the all solution to the problems Bitcoin is facing.\nI’m hesitant to definitively select a blockchain as the best because what is considered the best right now may not always be the best in the future. This is really a race between the blockchains. BCH has the upper hand right now but that doesn’t mean BTC can’t bring it back.\nWhat do you guys think?

According to Corcoran, the use of bitcoin in real estate is only going to become more common.\nGiving her reasons why, she said:\n“It’s peer-to-peer, with no central anything, and that’s why it’s so powerful. The main idea is to eliminate the middle guy.”\nInterestingly, she is of the opinion that banks won’t exist in the next 10 years, arguing that they won’t be ‘needed if bitcoin does what I believe it’s going to do.’\nThe use of bitcoin to purchase real estate is certainly not a new thing. While it hasn’t become a major payment choice there are more homeowners who are willing to accept the digital currency for the sale of their homes. So much so, that a San Diego brokerage is betting that the real estate industry lies with cryptocurrency, in particular bitcoin.\nIn a report from TechBullion earlier this month, Andrew Canter, the CEO and founder of Canter Companies, a financial and advisory investment firm located in San Diego, is hoping to tap into a demographic that has been underserved in the housing sector. As the adoption of bitcoin hasn’t been as widespread within the industry, those who own the cryptocurrency haven’t been able to use their coins in housing deals like they would want.\nCanter said:\n“We realized there is so much new wealth in the crypto space. There are a lot of new buyers and a lot of people that have seen their wealth fluctuate over the last year.”\nNotably, most of the houses up for sale that have the option of payment in cryptocurrency are worth a considerable amount. For instance, a client of Canter’s, who is selling a luxury property, has listed it at $7.8 million. Canter’s firm, however, is primarily targeting the crypto rich who have the money to spend.\nHe explained by adding that:\n“Our job is to make sure our clients are aware of emerging technologies and trends. After carefully studying this industry, it’s clear there is an entire new class of wealthy individuals which are underserved and our mission will be to help bridge that gap between them and our real estate clients. This won’t be a one-time campaign. We’ll continue to research and implement different strategies to gain access.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

With charts for the top 20 coins mostly stationary, barring a 5% upswing in the prices of both VeChain and Bitcoin Cash, the limelight is on cryptocurrency adoption…\nCoinbase is boasting a 1000% increase in their transaction capacity since last year, along with an impressive 1000 dedicated staff. Meanwhile, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce delivered a hopeful speech for investors, discussing tokens and other crypto regulation. Finally, VeChain and PwC shared their 2018 market survey for non-financial blockchain adoption in China.\nBefore we dive into those stories, you should know this week’s hottest story: some of Wall Street’s biggest names are pushing to open Bitcoin exchanges of their own . Coinbase pushes to dominate the market\nCoinbase has long been the fiat exchange of choice for investors big and small. However, it has struggled to impress clients with its questionable stability and inconsistent customer support, especially through the huge expansion the cryptocurrency market has experienced since 2016.\nIn this recent report, Coinbase boasts a 1000% increase in their transaction capacity since Q3 of 2017, and claims to have a worldwide team of over 1000 dedicated personnel. The report doesn’t hesitate to share their battle against platform instability, with over 99.99% uptime in the month of April.\nAlso of note is a recent $8 billion valuation for the company, up significantly from the previous quote of $1.6 billion. SEC commissioner Peirce delivers a hopeful speech for investors\nThe SEC is tasked with regulating all sorts of securities across the USA, and so it’s no wonder their name crops up with every discussion of cryptocurrency regulation.\nThis week, SEC commissioner Peirce delivered an open-minded speech on the topic of ICOs, tokens, and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. His words are generally good news for the market; quotes such as “There is a risk, when something truly innovative comes along, that regulators will focus only on the harms the innovation may bring and miss entirely the opportunity it presents to improve people’s lives” suggest a more lenient approach to regulation in the cryptocurrency market than previously anticipated. VeChain and PwC jointly release China market report for non-financial blockchain use\nAdoption is a topic on everyone’s minds, so when global professional service provider PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) team up with one of East Asia’s top crypto projects — VeChain — to conduct a market survey about China’s view on the blockchain, it’s no joke.\nOver 85% of respondents saw the blockchain as being inherently “tamper-resistant”, while many of them were optimistic about the future of its usage — especially within those who had a firmer grasp on the industry.\nThe report also explores industries that might seek to benefit from blockchain usage, proposing the logistics industry as the runner-up to finance.

We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water. […] There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so. Dealing With ‘Incompatible’ Crypto\nAs Britain’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell is in a unique situation in terms of Ankara’s perspective on cryptocurrency.\nLate last year, Bitcoinist reported on how government advisors had determined that Bitcoin and altcoins were “not compatible” with Islamic tradition and were thus unsuitable for Muslims.\nIn response to a civil request, Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, said:\nBuying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.\nCountering the suspicion, however, Singh pointed out that Western capitalism had produced its worst crashes specifically due to the presence of the speculation to which some Islamic scholars object.\nSingh added:\nWould we have had […] the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system?\nWhat do you think about Shacklewell Lane Mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin?

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price dropped by around 4 percent from $8,300 to $7,850. Bitcoin Price Trend\nAs CCN previously reported , the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to three major factors: Mt. Gox sell-off in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy, and scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb.\nThese three factors led investors to lose confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. By targeting a small portion of their user base to forfeit tax IDs and personal identification, Bitfinex led large-scale investors to become fearful of a potential government intervention and withdrew big sums of funds from the exchange.\nIn South Korea, due to the controversy surrounding UPbit and Bithumb, local investors have become bewildered, not knowing whether the local cryptocurrency market can be trusted or not.\nDespite the drastic improvement in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency industry and the entrance of major financial institutions, the overly strong downtrend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies have disallowed the market to rebound and initiate a corrective rally.\nIt is likely that in the short-term, the BTC price drops to the lower end of $7,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo suggested on May 22.\n“Pretty sure $8,000 support on BTCUSD is gonna fail. Next support, low $7,000s (though that could fail too). Then I’m expecting another dead kitten taking us into July – September period when BTC unwinds completely from mania phase and is ready for an accumulation phase,” said Woo.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin has already started to show oversold conditions, which would normally result in a strong rebound for BTC. But, due to the strong downtrend of the bitcoin price, the low RSI of bitcoin will likely be dismissed and bears will continue to push the price to the lower end of $7,000.\nBitcoin has successfully minimized its downtrend at the $7,700 mark, recording a slight bounce back to $7,850. However, if the bitcoin price declines below $7,700, it is likely that the bitcoin price stabilizes in the $7,300 region in the short-term. Tokens\nIn the cryptocurrency market, trading tokens is similar to leverage trading, because tokens often increase or decline in value by larger margins in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies.\nOntology, Aelf, ICON, 0x, Decentraland, Ziliqa, and AirSwap, all of which have recorded over 20 percent gains against bitcoin over the past week, have recorded losses in the range of 4 to 12 percent against bitcoin and 8 to 16 percent against the US dollar.\nIf the BTC price fails to rebound to the $8,000 region and remains in the lower end of $7,000 throughout this week, it is highly likely that tokens will continue to drop against both bitcoin and US dollar.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Mining them is 60 per cent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to US$2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin. sentifi.com Market voices on:\n\"Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,\" said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. SEE ALSO: Bitcoin a shadowy new realm as US weighs security clearances\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan (S$75.7 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Mr Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from US$1,000 in January last year to more than US$19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about US$8,400.\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong-based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly US$17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nAccording to mainland media reports, Mr Jiang, while visiting Canaan's factory, said: \"No matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you're still a chip company, and I hope you list in China.\"\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise US$2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between US$500 million and US$1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\nOther companies are also jumping onto the bandwagon, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Mr Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.

For this demo, researchers Tadge Dryja and Alin S. Dragos built a test oracle to broadcast the recent price of U.S. dollars in satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoins, which anyone can grab and use for their smart contracts.\nIt's a notable step forward for the idea, one first proposed by lightning inventor Dryja last summer . However, this is the first time it's been implemented as a prototype with working code.\nDragos told CoinDesk:\n\"We built this as a standalone feature of our lightning network software. We chose data what we thought would be cool, U.S. dollars, but it could be any data you want, whether weather or a stock.\"\nDragos stressed that the demo is \"experimental\" and \"shouldn't be used for real money.\" That said, he and other MIT researchers are convinced that with the help of the lightning network, bitcoin might one day scale to capacities originally envisioned by its early users.\nAs part of that work, MIT researchers have already created an implementation for the lightning network called lit , and this oracle code is an add-on of that work.\n\"We at DCI, we really believe in the lightning network,\" Dragos said. \"Bitcoin doesn't scale very well. I decided there has to be something better. Turns out what's better is lightning. It's the way to scale.\" Bitcoin smart contracts\nBut while lightning provides scale, smart contracts add other new functionality to bitcoin. For example, should the tech in MIT's test be implemented, you could make some sort of a bet based on what's happening in the world.\nOr, in this case, a futures contract. Alice promises to pay Bob whatever the price of dollars is in satoshis on a certain day, say Friday. If a dollar is worth 12,150 satoshis by the end of the week, then she will end up paying that.\nIt's a kind of advanced smart contract use case that is usually not associated with bitcoin.\n\"When folks think smart contracts, they think ethereum. Their scripting language is much richer,\" Dragos admitted.\nBut, he argues that with some workarounds, bitcoin can do the same thing.\n\"It's not as developer friendly because bitcoin didn't go in that direction, but you can use it. You have to be a little creative,\" Dragos said.\nIn short, it uses Dryja's \"discreet log contracts\" scheme to broadcast data to the smart contracts. One of the most important advantages of this scheme is scalability, because most of the data doesn't need to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe other is privacy, since oracles don't have any way of knowing who's using the data they're broadcasting.\n\"We're introducing a model where oracles are not aware of who's using the data they're using,\" Dragos said. Some 'quandaries'\nBut while this simple demo is now complete, Dragos and Dryja think there are many outstanding questions and \"quandaries,\" as Dragos put it. \"From the individual oracle's perspective, they're going to want to make some money. We're going to have to understand that,\" Dragos said.\nAnother is that the oracle at this point is trusted. But there might be a way to minimize this trust by allowing a user to use many oracles at once.\nBut there's a certain point where MIT DCI hopes to stop working on the technology and pass it off to someone else.\n\"We're working with companies that might implement this,\" Dragos said. And though he couldn't name names, he mentioned they are \"big company\" partners of the DCI.\nThe hope is these bigger companies will be better at understanding what normal users want from the software. So, while MIT DCI built a prototype demonstrating how the underlying technology really works, they haven't produced an app as mindlessly easy to use as say, Venmo or Facebook.\n\"UX is not our core expertise,\" Dragos said.\nNow it's open for people to use for whatever oracle data they want. So, it's up to the community to decide if it's worthwhile to use or not.\n\"It's a hard guess. It could be a significant deal if people use it. But we don't know what people are going to be using it for,\" he added.\nDragos stated:\n\"New technologies are available all the time, that doesn't mean they end up making it though.\"\nLightning image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem\nAmerican bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings\nFurther, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n“DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’\nIndividuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon’s discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?
