May 16, 2018\nZCash has found the support at 76.4% Fibs that is btc 0.0265. From that point the uptrend has started and price reached btc 0.035 while breaking above the 200 Moving Average. On a corrective wave down, ZEC/BTC rejected the uptrend trendline followed by an explosive growth.\nThis time ZEC has reached the high at btc 0.045 and it seems that the uptrend is likely to continue as there are no signals at this point of a trend reversal. The next strong resistance is seen at 76.4% Fibs that is btc 0.05, that could be reached in a very short period of time.\nBut on a downside, the correction down is possible, down to the btc 0.036, where previously support was formed. Only break and close that support could invalidate bullish outlook and send price down to btc 0.026. SHARE Please enter your name here You have entered an incorrect email address!

The answer is NO. While many individuals see it as an anonymous cryptocurrency or payment platform, Bitcoin, like many other cryptos is private but pseudo-anonymous.\nWhile it doesn’t need users to provide their details, all the transactions they’ve made or will make are public domains, and everyone in the blockchain will be able to see them. To secure its transactions Bitcoin uses a public key, which is a long string of letters and numbers called a BTC address. These public keys are not tied to any identifiable details and information; however, in theory, they can be used to gather information about an individual over time.\nCompared to cash transactions, Bitcoin offers less anonymity . Since the transaction blockchain acts as a public ledger, all the transactions you made are available publicly for the entire BTC network to see. But keep in mind that users’ anonymity is not compromised unless somebody can link their Bitcoin address to their identity in the real world.\nHow do Bitcoin Transactions Work?\nIn the simplest of terms, if you want to send some of your Bitcoin to someone, you need first to publish your intention, and the nodes will then scan the whole BTC network to confirm the following: You have the amount of BTC you want to send. You have not sent the Bitcoins to somebody else.\nOnce this information is validated, your transaction will be included in a block, which will be connected to the previous block, thus coining the term blockchain. All transactions are irreversible and cannot be tampered with.\nImportant facts to note about Bitcoin\nIf you’re interested in Bitcoin, there are some things you should be aware of. The leading digital currency allows for the exchange money in several ways than the conventional banks. For this reason, it is essential to take time to do your research and inform yourself first before joining the bandwagon and using BTC for any serious transactions. Always treat Bitcoin with the same caution and care as your physical wallet, or probably even more. Secure your Bitcoin wallet: BTC lets you easily transfer coins anywhere and allows you to be more in control of your currency. This great feature also comes with serious security concerns. Although the Bitcoin network can provide its users with extreme levels of security if appropriately used, it is always important to remember that you are still responsible for adopting good practices for your money to be protected. Bitcoin and all crypto's price are volatile: The increase or decrease in Bitcoin’s price is unpredictable. It can change over a short period because of aspects like novel market, young economy and illiquid markets at times. Therefore, it is not recommended to keep most of your savings with Bitcoin at this point. See it as an asset that bears the high risk, and only store money you are willing to risk. Any payments made are irreversible: You cannot reverse any Bitcoin transaction, and only the individual who received the funds can be refunded. This means that you should always be wary who you do business with. Know who to trust and always check that the organization, company or exchange you will sign up with are reputable.\nWhy Do People Regard Bitcoin as Anonymous?\nBitcoin is observed as anonymous every so often because of the following reasons: Bitcoin addresses on a protocol level are not linked to the user’s identity, unlike with a bank account or other payment schemes. Users have an option to create an entirely random and new BTC address at any time, without the need to provide their private information to anyone. Any transactions made are not linked to the user’s identity. In other words, anyone can transfer BTC successfully from any address to any other address without revealing any of his personal information. The receiver does not know the sender’s identity as well. All BTC transaction data are forwarded and transmitted through nodes to a set of random nodes on the Bitcoin network. While these nodes do link to one another via an IP address, it is not substantially clear for nodes if the data transactions they received were generated by the nodes they linked to, or if those nodes simply forwarded the data.\nBitcoin Network Analysis\nBitcoin being a public blockchain means that a lot of data is available to those individuals looking to explore the network. Bitcoin’s public ledger provides everyone with detailed information about the context such as the entire history of the transactions as well as the nature of every transaction ever made including values, user public keys and time.\nIt is possible for any marketing firm, intelligence agency and even an individual researcher to try and collect information about anyone’s real-world identity by analyzing Bitcoin’s network because of all the available data. Theoretically, people can use network analysis methods to determine a person’s identity connected to a BTC address over a long period.\nWhy It’s Important to Stay Anonymous\nIncreasing the level of your privacy will lower any risk of getting scammed or hacked by criminals. Once users have mastered security techniques, spreading its awareness will incrementally strengthen the Bitcoin blockchain against attackers and aggressors of all sorts. The Bitcoin’s system is constructed of solid and unyielding cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and different kinds of fraud. However, the human component in BTC transaction is always seen as the weakest link.\nEven though you will never be required to verify your identity physically to be able to download and use any BTC wallet, for average users, this is where the anonymity of the system ends. As soon as your BTC address becomes connected to your real-world identity, your anonymity might be compromised for that particular address, which is a difficult scenario to avoid when you’re receiving deliveries or doing business.\nOne of the solutions to prevent this is to get an anonymous Bitcoin wallet, which is a wallet that keeps all your crypto-related activities private as broadly outlined at https://www.abitgreedy.com/anonymous-bitcoin-wallet/ . Most wallets do not have this feature, especially if you will opt for a mobile wallet. Some of the most popular anonymous BTC wallets are Samourai, Jaxx and Electrum wallets.\nAlways remember that Bitcoin, in its default state, should not be considered as an anonymous payment system. It being pseudo-anonymous is unsubstantiated at best, which can be compromised easily by a basic and simple net surveillance. Though compared to credit cards, Bitcoin by default is still very much private, but less so compared to cash.\nBy Ronny Martelli\n© 2018 Copyright Ronny Martelli - All Rights Reserved\nDisclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Bloomberg News\nThis wasn't the first time Dorsey had spoken fondly of digital currencies. The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would \"love to see a digital currency thrive.\" In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it's introducing bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n\"I'll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,\" he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company's board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\n\"This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,\" Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York's Blockchain Week. \"We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.\" Why now is the perfect time to capitalize on Dual Interface EMV cards.

Being able to welcome Daos as a backer signals that we are well on our way to creating the ideal conditions for greater trust between global funds and international investors.”\nDaos Capital is a fund run by a group of senior investors and venture capitalists that specializes in blockchain and cryptocurrency trading. It is an AI-driven fund capable of delivering various trading strategies with different levels of risk to meet the needs and preferences of their investors.\nThe fund is specially calibrated to respond to the unique nature of the cryptocurrency market by screening existing funds and assessing benchmark professional fund standards and then employing short-term mechanisms to mitigate the effects of cryptocurrency volatility. Their main focus is leveraging arbitrage space on behalf of their investors on the secondary market of digital assets. Helping Investors Navigate the World of Cryptocurrencies\nNavigating the chaotic world of cryptocurrencies can be a daunting task. There is great interest by potential market participants, but they don’t have a central space to collect the information and data they need in order to be successful. Befund is a non-profit project that was created to connect novice and smaller “retail” crypto enthusiasts with professional fund managers.\nWhile the Befund team believes that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will become part of the mainstream in due course, scams still pop up in the sector, which understandably makes new market players nervous. The Befund Service Platform is able to address these issues by offering the expertise of their venture capital specialists, who conduct in-depth due diligence regarding new ICOs and funds and share their insights with subscribers. The project is designed to allow experienced venture capital professionals to provide retail investors with the perks that large funds can unlock.\nThe platform will also serve professional traders and fund managers, who will have the ability to create learning modules, subscription platforms and more using Befund’s SaaS platform. The company’s own public chain (called BFDChain) has been developed to serve the financial industry and will enable users to create their own decentralized financial applications, which will promote further collaboration in the financial industry.\nThe overall goal of the project is to encourage widespread participation across the entire financial industry in the crypto market, by enabling subscribers to interact directly with industry experts who have backgrounds in angel investing, financial planning, and private equity. The company is building its own standardized blockchain-based service platform that complies with various jurisdictional regulations as an informational resource for cryptocurrency funds, fund managers, and token holders anywhere in the world. They are also working to set up a partnership with a provider of compliance audit services, to give their users assurance that they are receiving trusted crypto financial planning advice.\nThe Befund Service Platform is made up of a team of financial, technology, and legal industry experts, including CEO, Winston Zhang, who has worked as a senior officer for a number of international companies, including IBM, Oracle, and i2. The company’s COO is Chris Wu, who has served in senior roles in the past at Duncan-Williams Investment Bank in China and currently at the Trivantis Corporation. He holds Master’s degrees in computing and AI technology, as well as Finance. They are joined by CTO, Jack Hong, who has been CTO of Mars Venture Technology (Beijing) and GM and CTO of Heze Technology (Beijing). Khalil Lin, Director of Overseas Operations, is a JD with expertise in blockchain and media in the United States and specializes in global jurisdictional laws around the technology.\nAll of the platform’s subscription and other tools will be accessed using the BFDChain token (BFDT). Major holders of BFDTs may also be entitled to participate in exclusive advanced fund sales conducted on some of the platforms created using the Befund technology solution. A total of 500 million BFDT will be available for sale, with a maximum of two billion BFDT to be issued. This will include the sale of 9% to strategic backers, a 25% private placement (including the public crowdsale) with whitelisted buyers who pass their KYC procedure, and the distribution of 20% to the Befund team.\nYou can find out more about Befund by visiting http://www.befund.io/ and its telegram group at https://t.me/BefundOfficial .\nDo you think that Befund will help lower the barrier to entry into cryptocurrencies for new investors?

Bitcoin was designed for anonymity and security, but paradoxically there are many vulnerabilities associated with owning cryptocurrency. This may lead to many difficult situations for publicized cryptocurrency owners, as their assets can be easily (and without a trace) stolen from them, via extortion or the loss of their private key.\nAs a matter of fact, the first significant Bitcoin theft, of 25,000 BTC in today’s market value, worth of about 231 million dollars, happened in 2011 when Bitcoin was only $19.\nSo what should cryptocurrency owners do? How can they protect themselves from potential threats and limit the danger to their crypto finances?\nAs controversial as it may be (for the crypto community), the solution may be found in centralized services such as Xapo, especially in cases when anonymity is no longer an option. What is Xapo?\nIt all started when the progressive Argentinian thinker and entrepreneur Wences Casares spotted the unique business opportunity in “being the bank” of digital holdings for the global elite.\nCasares with his dogmatic approach towards cryptocurrency (he believes that Bitcoin will be the only digital currency to survive them all) fights hard to create a vast and secure network that compliment his beliefs. Having spent several years and unknown amounts of money in constructing what is probably the most secure network of underground vaults dispersed on undisclosed physical locations across three different continents.\nFour years later, Casares launched a Hong Kong-based startup named “Xapo” which is the first custodian to capitalize on the prevalent security concerns associated with storing Bitcoins. The custodian is subjected to regulatory purview. Its Swiss subsidiary falls under the Financial Services Standards Association that requires it to comply with all anti-money laundering (AML) rules.\nXapo has a Delaware-based corporation that is registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several US states.\nXapo serves its American customers through this corporation, ensuring adherence to all necessary US compliance. Xapo’s Services\nWorldwide, Xapo provides a cryptocurrency wallet, Bitcoin debit card (no longer available) and of course, cold storage vaults. Bitcoin broker – You can purchase Bitcoin on Xapo using a different set of payment preferences. They offer Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Online Payment Processor and Cash payment preferences but not all of the payment options are available for every country. Xapo Wallet – Mobile app and online access are available, they offer a way to store multiple fiat currencies and direct transfer of funds to and from the Xapo Vault. Xapo Debit Card – Xapo Wallet is directly connected with Xapo Debit Card, that includes functions like the standard debit card, the only difference is that it is backed with Bitcoins instead using fiat currency. This debit card was available in accepted countries, but in January 2018, Visa instructed the company to stop all of their card operations. Xapo Vault – Well known cold-storage maximum security vault that safely stores Bitcoins.\nAfter setting up the infrastructure, Casares undertook the laborious task of persuading the wealthiest business owners in Silicon Valley that Bitcoin was going to become the only global, high-value crypto asset. That they should invest hard fiat in and that his security system was the best for them.\nHe did acquire a very exclusive clientele which brought him fame all across the States and a nickname “Patient Zero” for being the first protagonist for Bitcoin and related business opportunities. Xapo’s Investors\nAccording to anonymous Xapo clients, today’s total value of Bitcoin supply stored in the vaults is $10 billion. In other words, it holds 7% of the world’s Bitcoin market cap owned by a single entity or more than 98% of all deposits retained by about 5760 American banks.\nIn order to provide enhanced protection for his clients’ BTCs, Casares relocated Xapo’s HQ in Switzerland after adopting a decommissioned military bunker into a crypto storage facility.\nXapo’s most prominent investors are Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Fortress Investment Group, Ribbit Capital and Emergence Capital Partners, GrayScale, CoinShares, etc. who entirely gathered more than $540 million.\nXapo’s high demand is proven by the investments of billionaires Reid Hoffman, Mike Novogratz, John Reed, Dee Hock and many others. How Does Xapo Safeguard Its Holdings?\nThe Xapo’s security system is of cutting-edge technology. One needs to pass a couple of checkpoints of armed guards, reinforced concrete corridors, enhanced steel doors, biometric locks with state-of-the-art finger recognition software and constant visual surveillance of every inch of the vault.\nIt starts with multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation on big computer servers that hold the bitcoin and which have never been connected to any networks, particularly the Internet, nor they never will.\nThe vaults have a failover backup mechanism. This is why Xapo is safest cold-storage security system on the planet. Xapo has a well-tested protocol that demands a flawless verification of a client’s identity and authentication of the request before it manually signs the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations.\nApproval from three separate vaults is required for any transaction to be authorized. As an added safeguard, the entire process takes upward of 48 hours for requested Bitcoin to show up in the Xapo wallet from the company’s vaults.\nShould the client wish to make a withdrawal on business days, the procedure can stretch up to 4 days if the weekend comes in between. Both the cost incurred in the transactions and the time taken will be too high for it to be viable.\nFurthermore, should the client prefer trading the BTC for another cryptocurrency, there is an added cost for transferring the bitcoin to an exchange wallet. Not to mention the additional waiting time. Xapo’s Exaggeration\nXapo’s solution to the Bitcoin’s security issue is not applicable nor useful for mass usage which means that more independent, faster and cheaper solutions are necessary. It is impressive that a service like Xapo’s exists, mainly because it points out the need for better solutions that all investors can take advantage of.\nAdditionally, it is a paradox to the cryptocurrencies’ defining security features like independence, anonymity, and decentralization.\n“One thing that needs to be a major priority of the crypto community is increasing usability and security of self-sovereign authentication models. That is, we need to work much harder to design wallets that are secure for regular users without introducing centralized keyholders.” – Vitalik Buterin. However…\nThere is a lot of value to having a verified custodian keeping your cryptocurrency wealth more secure than you could ever do it yourself. In the eyes of the extremely rich, most often anonymity is not an option, therefore having somebody dependable is truly a blessing.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin underground", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:09:38.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb70c8a34eec0317afe92d7372747304cd826910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOo82qSpEDBkSEahKAEVoCreyluweb2mb8OMnGu_yNJOZSl8UML0bzCuZeOpDhs4hIhBliuaDlmDUmE5hGkQ32OVfsFZRW9YsJHHBVQ3IYs1k-", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "2\" Bitcoin Magnet – Wood Burned Magnet, Pyrography Art, Wood Magnet, Bitcoin", "title_full": "2\" Bitcoin Magnet – Wood Burned Magnet, Pyrography Art, Wood Magnet, Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rnHdpH.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb70c8a34eec0317afe92d7372747304cd826910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOo82qSpEDBkSEahKAEVoCreyluweb2mb8OMnGu_yNJOZSl8UML0bzCuZeOpDhs4hIhBliuaDlmDUmE5hGkQ32OVfsFZRW9YsJHHBVQ3IYs1k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Specials", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "2\" Bitcoin Magnet – Wood Burned Magnet, Pyrography Art, Wood Magnet, Bitcoin", "text": "\n☼ Detailed, intricate Bitcoin-themed magnet wood burned by hand.\nDimensions: ☼ 2\" / 5 cm (round) & 3 mm thick.\nDetails: ☼ Handmade (not laser engraved.) ☼ Made with a high quality, super strong neodymium magnet.

Do not be mistaken in thinking there will be any major upward momentum for all of these coins in the coming hours, though. Right now, the Bitcoin price is starting to recover a bit, as reaching $8,500 again is the first order of business right now. Bitcoin Price Recovery has to Start Somewhere\nThis past week has not been all too great for most cryptocurrencies. Especially the Bitcoin price has gone through another rough patch. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price dropped from $8,750 all the way to $8,179. It is a pretty big drop, considering how things could have easily gone the other way as well. Unfortunately, it seems manipulators and market makers do not want any positive cryptocurrency momentum to materialize at this time.\nWith this week’s dip in the books, it now seems the Bitcoin price is clawing its way out of this hole again. Over the past few hours, the value has risen to $8,435 again, which is a positive start. While it is only a drop in the proverbial bucket, positive momentum has to start somewhere. In the case of the Bitcoin price, a $300 increase in mere hours is a pretty solid trend overall. This doesn’t automatically mean we will see this trend continue all that long, though.\nThe net result over the past 24 hours is a decline in Bitcoin price by 3.98%. It is better than a 7% decline, but it still shows how brittle this cryptocurrency really is in 2018. Any sort of negative momentum will immediately send the value crashing, even though there is no news that should affect the markets in such a way. Investors are spooked very easily, which only highlights the need for decentralized solutions rather than centralized exchanges.\nWith $7.26bn in 24-hour trading volume , the demand to buy and sell Bitcoin has not diminished in the slightest. Granted, there is a slight dip in volume compared to last week, but it represents less than 10%. How this will play out in the coming hours and days, remains to be seen. If the volume remains at this level, it seems evident the Bitcoin price will continue to rise later today. Reaching $8,500 will still be an uphill battle, though.\nJudging by the exchanges ranked by trading volume, it seems USDT trading still remains very popular. OKEx, Binance, and Huobi are all in the top four with their USDT trading pairs. Bitfinex is the only exchange with a fiat currency pair in the top five. OKEx’s TRUE/BTC pair is in fifth place as of right now. A very interesting development in the world of Bitcoin trading, and one to keep an eye on.\nFor the time being, we will have to wait and see how the Bitcoin price evolves in the coming hours. Given the bearish pressure on the cryptocurrency industry throughout most of 2018, it is evident things are not looking all that great right now. Then again, the rebound will start any day now, and when it happens, it is evident the Bitcoin price- along with most other cryptocurrencies – will see some solid momentum.

Trading volume is much lower than in the bitcoin futures markets on fellow US exchanges CME and CBOE — which thus far have attracted more bitcoin bears than bulls — but the firm reports that volume has increased to $30 million per month over the past quarter, with individual trades averaging $60,000 in notional value.\nThe bitcoin savings product is one of a number institutionally-focused services that have been timed to coincide with “Blockchain Week” in New York City.\nAs CCN reported , cryptocurrency brokerage Coinbase unveiled a slew of products aimed at institutional traders, while Japanese financial holding company Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger (no association with LedgerX) to provide institutional traders with access to secure cryptoasset custody.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juthica chou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T04:19:23.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95babeee4bb02e98a73073116d282f772b856ea0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3xECZYh3EO5ouGp9IdO7n6KNNdR.YESAgJZRH7ccSriSiu5Gy06Mh_Xa97.SGN2WiFnfDxSHHYIr", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Evolution of blockchain without Bitcoin: Sound money -> crappy database -> Ponzi scheme : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Evolution of blockchain without Bitcoin: Sound money -> crappy database -> Ponzi scheme : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://i.redditmedia.com/7SRWAnPe83TzvhIZ5OwB6jhHo6sKhH8f156eHWM_cbM.jpg?w=320&amp;s=852c4f6dc508f1f4250724e4050d0394", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95babeee4bb02e98a73073116d282f772b856ea0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3xECZYh3EO5ouGp9IdO7n6KNNdR.YESAgJZRH7ccSriSiu5Gy06Mh_Xa97.SGN2WiFnfDxSHHYIr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Evolution of blockchain without Bitcoin: Sound money -> crappy database -> Ponzi scheme : Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

Legitimizing Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in the EU\nBoth cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallets operating in the European Union’s jurisdiction are now required to carry out the exact same know-your-customer (KYC) checks as traditional banks.\nThe regulatory move comes as the European Union continues its widespread attack — which also sees changes and regulation affecting areas of finance and traditional banking — on money laundering and terrorist financing.\nAs noted by Reuters , the increased transparency in regards to cryptocurrency trading and storage will almost certainly detract from major cryptocurrencies being used for illicit means, as KYC regulations will make it significantly easier for law enforcement to catch money launderers and terrorist financiers. As an added benefit, it should also make hackers’ lives more difficult should they target said exchanges and wallets.\nOf course, nothing is stopping European citizens from using cryptocurrency exchanges outside the reach of EU authority. Nevertheless, the world’s major cryptocurrency markets are moving in the same direction, with South Korea having already imposed KYC regulations on its exchanges and the United States expected to follow suit eventually.\nThough many in the cryptocurrency space aren’t particularly fond of KYC barriers, such data collection undoubtedly lends significantly more legitimacy to cryptocurrency than previously existed.\nOne should also not take the EU’s new KYC requirements as an indication that the political and economic union is negative towards cryptocurrency. Rather, the continent’s alliance has been pushing to legitimize cryptocurrencies’ underlying technology in recent months.\nOn April 10th, 22 countries in the European Union signed a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership , which is aimed at cementing Europe as a world leader in the development and launch of blockchain technologies.\nThe international partnership claims to be “a vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide blockchain applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.”\nWhat do you think about KYC requirements? Do you think such regulatory measures legitimize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Be sure to let us know in the comments below!\nImages courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Wikipedia Commons.

The ban is expected to come into action at the end of June to early July.\nHere is the state of play at the time of writing:\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 6% over the last 24 hours to US$8,225.31, reducing its market capitalisation to US$140.1 billion.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price is off 6.3% since this time yesterday to US$686.13. This leaves Ethereum with a market capitalisation of US$68.2 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has tumbled over 8.5% during the period to 68.2 U.S. cents, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$26.7 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has plunged over 12% lower since this time yesterday to US$1,252.66, reducing its market capitalisation to US$21.5 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has fallen 13.4% over the last 24 hours to US$12.35, bringing the EOS market capitalisation down to US$10.6 billion.\nOutside the top five the declines have been worse, possibly due to concerns that some of the smaller cryptocurrencies will struggle to gain the attention of traders without advertising.\nSince this time yesterday the Litecoin (LTC) price is down 7.4%, Cardano (ADA) is 11% lower, Stellar (XLM) is down 9.5%, IOTA (MIOTA) has fallen 4.3%, and TRON (TRX) has seen its price fall 10.8%.\nWhile the market is in panic mode once again, it is hard to deny that the move by Bing is a good one. Restricting bad apples from participating in the industry can only be a good thing.\nBut this selloff does highlight how high risk the industry can be. In light of this, I would urge that anyone dabbling in cryptocurrencies does it with money they can afford to lose.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nEveryone is talking about the artificial intelligence revolution.\nHarvard Business Review calls it, \"the most important general-purpose technology of our era.\"\nOne Google Insider predicts AI, \"will be as transformative as the discovery of electricity.\" And it already is transforming industry after industry.\nAfter all we have been hearing about AI for years...but it never really lived up to the hype...so what's finally unlocked this huge tidal wave of innovation?\nClick here to learn more!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Cardano dropped in the 5 to 13 percent region, with Bitcoin Cash and EOS dropping 11 percent and 13.5 percent respectively. Bitcoin Cash and EOS\nTraders have often described Bitcoin Cash investment as leveraged bitcoin trading because on both the upside and downside, Bitcoin Cash moves by larger margins. Throughout April, as the market continued to recover and bitcoin started to gain momentum in the $9,500 region, Bitcoin Cash experienced a 10 to 20 percent increase in value quite regularly.\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency market started to fall, Bitcoin Cash began to record losses with significantly larger margins in comparison to bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, on May 16, Bitcoin Cash fell by more than 6 percent against both bitcoin and Ethereum, which also fell by 5 percent.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bitcoin Cash is at 50, signifying a neutral zone for BCH. If the RSI of BCH signifies an oversold condition, the price of BCH could bounce relatively quickly in the short-term but given that the RSI of BCH is neutral and both exponential and simple moving averages are demonstrating a negative short-term trend for BCH, it is likely that the price of BCH will continue to fall over the next 24 hours.\nOther cryptocurrencies and tokens that have performed strongly against the US dollar over the past month such as EOS and 0x (ZRX) have also slumped over the past week. EOS has dropped by more than 38 percent from its monthly peak in April against bitcoin.\nWithin a period of two weeks, the price of EOS declined from 0.0024 to 0.00149 BTC, by 38.17 percent. Considering that the price of EOS increased from 0.0009 to 0.0024 BTC from early April to April 29, the sudden drop in the price of EOS was unexpected.\nBut, the struggle of EOS, which has been able to secure strong momentum throughout April, demonstrates the current state of the market. Despite the initiation of the Blockchain Week in New York and the Consensus 2018 event, the cryptocurrency market is failing to rebound from its short-term losses. Bitcoin to $50,000\nOn CNBC, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated that he sees the price of bitcoin reaching $50,000 by the end of 2018 , despite the correction the market has seen from February to May.\nBitMEX, which supports margin trading, profits from both the downside and upside of bitcoin because traders can register short and long contracts.\n“If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said, emphasizing that his prediction of bitcoin reaching $50,000 is objective as increase in the price of bitcoin does not impact the profitability of the exchange.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto market sheds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:07:28.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d606d4da6a94c40c06e19ec9cb14744ccb67793", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKGWYj7gowKiSCXW3cNQXPbxrEGbf5.MqMEkBkvB1D9cP.asz9ST_56pnKQIxjDbM-", "site_full": "www.mpgh.net", "site": "mpgh.net", "site_section": "https://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=123", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Buying Accounts/Keys/Items - MPGH - MultiPlayer Game Hacking &amp; Cheats - Hacks, Cheats, Downloads, Trainers, Games", "title": "Fortnite vbucks for bitcoin", "title_full": "[WTB] Fortnite vbucks for bitcoin - MPGH - MultiPlayer Game Hacking & Cheats", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d606d4da6a94c40c06e19ec9cb14744ccb67793", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKGWYj7gowKiSCXW3cNQXPbxrEGbf5.MqMEkBkvB1D9cP.asz9ST_56pnKQIxjDbM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "an00z", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fortnite vbucks for bitcoin", "text": "Originally Posted by an00z Titles says it.

Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views\nWith the emergence and sustenance of the cryptocurrency industry, companies are now allocating their interests in a new suite of services – custody of cryptocurrencies . The move comes in the undeniable wake of established and upcoming firms alike from traditional sectors expressing their interest in cryptocurrency investing, seeking credible choices for storing their digital assets. Custodial Services A Rising Business Sector\nFilling this gap is Palo Alto-based bitcoin wallet provider BitGo, which unveiled its new custodial services on May 14, 2018, intending to rope in institutional investors with an eagle-eye on the cryptocurrency market. Sponsored Links\nThis new venture has emerged after BitGo acquired Kingdom Trust, a U.S.-qualified custodian of traditional financial assets, in January 2018. It perhaps took inspiration from the same, just in the crypto domain instead of traditional finance.\nAccording to the head of product at BitGo, Tracy Olsen, the custodial services will be classified into three different tiers, in order to cater to varied needs and risk-tolerance. She also informed that the company aims at being a 360-degree supplier of security solutions, instead of a mere custodian firm.\nThe three services tiers are: Qualified Custody (in alliance with Kingdom Trust), Institutional Custody, Self-managed custody.\nOlsen did not dive into the details of the total value of assets it holds, but revealed that 15 percent of the total bitcoin transactions take place through BitGo’s wallet.\nSpeaking about larger institutional firms, Olsen added that they consider bitcoin as a lucrative investment, and look towards widening their portfolios with coins like ether, ripple, and other digital currencies.\nBitGo experiences a high demand from customers for a wide variety of coins.

The technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have since been identified as having immense potential for disrupting the logistics and supply chain management (SCM) industry. Sponsored Links Fred Smith. Source: GreenTechMedia\nWith many cutting-edge solutions being developed by startup companies, the established corporations seem forced to innovate or lose their perch. FedEx appears to be well aware of this as the company is making significant efforts to develop its legacy blockchain-based solutions for logistics and SCM. FedEx CEO Talks Up Blockchain at Consensus\n“Blockchain has the ability to completely change logistics as we know it,” said Fred Smith, Chairman, and CEO of FedEx at the 2018 Consensus Conference. He expressed confidence in the fact that blockchain could have significant implications for the industry. He identified the technology as the “next frontier” that would transform the industry altogether. As a result, the company is already carrying out a pilot test of a blockchain logistics framework to track large and high-value cargo.\nIn recent times, the company has invested heavily in blockchain and internet of things protocols. Many experts believe both technologies are part of the five technologies that will establish the fourth industrial age. According to Smith, it was incumbent on the company to dedicate resources to cutting-edge technology to improve its pedigree and stay ahead of the competition. As a result, the company is collaborating with Blockchain in Transport Alliance, a group that focuses on developing standard practices for technological advancements in transportation and logistics. The group also firmly believes that blockchain holds to key to faster and more efficient transportation and logistics framework, thereby freeing up capital to work on other areas of the business process.\nAlso speaking at the Conference, Robert Carter, the Chief Information Officer at FedEx introduced TRON, a Bluetooth-based tracking sensor, one that the company has invested in heavily. Carter said the company had filed a record number of patents on account of the low-energy tracking device. TRON is part of the company’s commitment to utilizing technology to stay relevant in the industry. According to Smith, failure to embrace emerging technologies like blockchain is a recipe for disaster. According to him, such companies run the risk of going into extinction. DHL Includes Blockchain-based Logistics Solution in 2018 Blockchain Report\nIn a related development, DHL, another logistics behemoth is also recognizing the importance of blockchain technology in the global logistics paradigm. The company identified the technology as an essential cog in the wheel of progress of the industry, even including ShipChain in its 2018 blockchain report titled “Blockchain in Logistics.” ShipChain is an Ethereum-based digital SCM and logistics infrastructure. DHL believes ShipChain will be game-changer in the industry, eliminating inefficiencies and enabling smart interaction and management across the entire SCM value-chain.\nMany corporations are developing and testing numerous blockchain-based solutions for SCM and logistics. These applications are being implemented in pharmaceuticals, aviation, shipping, and even the food industry.

When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!\nToday, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don’t believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I’m doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes.”\nThe New York Times reported on the Pineapple fund in late December of last year and stated it had already donated to 13 charities, including million-dollar donations to The Water Project (providing clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (who guard people’s digital rights).\n“Pine” subsequently made periodic announcements on reddit of donations to other charities, including: Watsi: who use technology to help provide universal healthcare. BitGive Foundation: who aim to increase grow global blockchain-based philanthropy. KDE: “a free software community dedicated to creating an open and user-friendly computing experience…and vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation.” The Free Software Foundation: “working to secure freedom for computer users by promoting the development and use of free… software…and by campaigning against threats to computer user freedom.” Mona: who support the education of women and girls to help alleviate global poverty. New Story: “an innovative model for directly funding homes in impoverished communities, helping families break the cycle of living in survival mode” in Haiti. Internet Archive: “a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more.” The Sustainable Ocean Alliance: “global organization that advances the impact of start-ups, social enterprises and youth-centered initiatives that are developing solutions to protect and sustain our ocean.” Pencils of Promise: builders of close to 468 (and counting) schools in impoverished areas.\n…and… MAPS: who “develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana…including MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD.”\n“Pine” told Forbes that he or she suffers from erratic emotions as a consequence of Borderline Personality Disorder. It was during an experimental trial using Katamine to treat the disorder that “Pine” came up with the idea for The Pineapple Fund:\n“With ketamine, I realized that having all those Bitcoins isn’t helping me, so I should really do something with it. It took a little bit more thinking before deciding on anonymously donating most of it to charity. My identity, to my friends and social circles, wouldn’t change. I won’t be hounded down for money. And I could actually do something good in this world, with minimal effort. That is how the Pineapple Fund was born.”\n“Pine” also told Forbes, “I’m not going to glorify psychedelics either because they can be positive and negative…I also recognize the important key is therapy because, during one IV, I realized how much I wished my therapist was next to me; and MAPS’ trials (aren)’t about MDMA. (They’re) about MDMA with therapy.”\nYou can read “Pine’s” farewell message below: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cali haan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:25:36.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "521f0db3feac23992aef0774c0c588951a4c8fbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLNhoNhsaFIO4uscjWHMfa201I2xtcMEstFWmhScq8eB4-", "site_full": "altcointoday.com", "site": "altcointoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator", "title_full": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.617, "main_image": "https://altcointoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/412611-taxact-online-2016-plus-edition-tax-year-2015.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "521f0db3feac23992aef0774c0c588951a4c8fbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLNhoNhsaFIO4uscjWHMfa201I2xtcMEstFWmhScq8eB4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator", "text": "By TaxAct\nIf you are a U.S. resident that invested in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in 2017, you may have recently received a tax document from the trading platform or cryptocurrency exchange you use and may need to pay taxes. While there is currently very little guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrency, one thing is clearly defined. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes. That means you likely received a tax document because you either experienced a capital gain on that virtual investment in 2017 or received cryptocurrency as compensation, which is seen as ordinary income to the IRS.\nFor practical purposes, the IRS has issued guidance defining cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as virtual currencies. This guidance is subject to interpretation, but for most people the main things to consider from a tax perspective are: How long you held your Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies from purchase to sale? If held for less than a year, any profit may be liable for short-term capital gains tax. If held for longer than a year, any profit may be liable for long-term capital gains tax. What is your tax filing status and taxable income? That will determine your tax bracket and the tax rate on any Bitcoin profits. What is your state tax rate? That will determine how much you may owe in state taxes. Bitcoin Tax Calculator Instructions Part 1: Enter Your Personal Details\nStep 1: Select the tax year you would like to calculate your estimated taxes. Step 2: Select your tax filing status. Step 3: Enter your taxable income excluding any profit from Bitcoin sales. For most people, this is the same as adjusted gross income (AGI) . Step 4: Enter your state’s tax rate. Part 2: For each Bitcoin sale within a tax year\nStep 1: Enter the purchase date and purchase price. The purchase date can be any time up to December 31st of the tax year selected. Step 2: Enter the sale date and sale price. Make sure the sale date is within the tax year selected. Step 3: Repeat for all Bitcoin or cryptocurrency sales within the tax year selected.

His resignation comes as a surprise, especially since OKEx has been expanding internationally and has also become the largest cryptocurrency exchange by reported turnover. By Telegram\nAccording to Bloomberg , in an emailed statement on Monday, Lee’s decision to leave the company was personal as he wanted to “start a new life.” In a separate statement, a spokeswoman for Lee also mentioned that he found it “the greatest pleasure and an honour ” to work at OKEx. After a short break with his family, he will return to the blockchain and cryptocurrency community.\nLee’s image and biography were removed from the OKEx website. The company has not yet made any new announcements as to who Lee’s replacement will be. Advertisement\nWhile OKex was reported to be the largest cryptocurrency exchange by reported turnover, with more than $2 billion of cryptocurrency trades in the past 24 hours, there’s also been a suspicion that the cryptocurrency exchange is inflating their volumes. Despite surpassing Binance to become the most active cryptocurrency exchange in the world, the online cryptocurrency community remains skeptical of their numbers. CEO leaves amid international expansion\nLast month in April 2018, OKEx announced that it would be expanding to the Mediterranean island nation, Malta. The move is not much of a surprise considering Malta has invested in blockchain friendly regulations and legislation. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has also moved its team and resources to Malta.\n“Malta’s Virtual Financial Asset Act is a solid foundation for the industry and the government to work together in fostering the nascent blockchain/digital asset industry,” said Tim Byun, chief risk officer and head of government relations at OKEx. “More specifically, Malta’s sound risk-based approach will help cultivate a responsible, compliant, and healthy ecosystem.”\nOKEx is currently based out of Hong Kong, which is well-known for its business-friendly environment. However, in February 2018, Hong Kong has taken a stricter and harsher approach towards cryptocurrencies and ICOs . On the other hand, Malta is very cryptocurrency friendly. Government officials have also mentioned that their goal is to transform Malta into a blockchain island through friendly legislation.\n“We look forward to working with the Malta government as it is forward thinking and shares many of our same values: the most important of which are protection of traders and the general public compliance with Anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer standards, and recognition of the innovation and importance of continued development in the blockchain ecosystem,” said Chris Lee, the previous CEO of OKEx. OKEx surpassed Binance as the largest cryptocurrency exchange\nIn the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap , OKEx handled $2.1 billion in cryptocurrency trades, while Binance processed $1.9 billion in volume.\nThe cryptocurrency community is however skeptical of the numbers considering OKEx’s parent operator OKcoin was previously involved in a contract violation scandal that resulted in potentially inflating or falsifying trading volume.\nFurthermore, Sylvain Ribes, a popular cryptocurrency trader, and investor also released a report in March 2018 which detailed his study on trading volume and why he believes OKEx’s trading volume is mostly inflated . The report gained almost 17,000 claps on Medium with over 60 comments raising concerns over fake volumes of cryptocurrency exchanges.\nWhile it’s unclear whether the trade volume is genuine or inflated, Twitter user @AlistairMilne even questioned whether OKEx is “back to their old tricks?” OKEx has however not yet responded to any allegations on Twitter.\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

There was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair even broke the last swing low and it could continue to decline towards the $1,200 level.\nBitcoin cash price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now trading well below $1,300 with a bearish angle in the short term. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nYesterday, we discussed how $1,480 and $1,500 levels stopped the upside move in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price failed to move above the mentioned levels and declined sharply below $1,400. The decline was such that the price even broke the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,330 low to $1,495 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses and there was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair even settled below the $1,300 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. These are bearish signs below $1,300 and it seems like the price may continue to trade lower in the short term. It is currently trading near the $1,240 level with a lot of selling pressure. If it corrects higher it could test the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,495 high to $1,240 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price may continue to accelerate declines towards the $1,200 level. Any further declines would depend how buyers react around the stated $1,200 support level in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is accelerating momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has reached the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $1,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,300 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Tumbled Below $1,300 was last modified: May 16th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T12:31:22.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb302e8a3e4c4675d3a24e604d6040dd8dd72949", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRkFCIXsqRmhVBQ9NnZu4fu6T0vf.pQepqpSSKlO.JndEnHr53H.Bp9hxO.5B1RZpDegOL34Cd9bnKoVmWsMITGxS1bmDUiWL5L6HgdJ5ATA--", "site_full": "forex24.pro", "site": "forex24.pro", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) technical analysis May 17, 2018 | FOREX24.PRO", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) technical analysis May 17, 2018 | FOREX24.PRO", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://forex24.pro/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bit-028-min.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb302e8a3e4c4675d3a24e604d6040dd8dd72949", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRkFCIXsqRmhVBQ9NnZu4fu6T0vf.pQepqpSSKlO.JndEnHr53H.Bp9hxO.5B1RZpDegOL34Cd9bnKoVmWsMITGxS1bmDUiWL5L6HgdJ5ATA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC/USD) technical analysis May 17, 2018 | FOREX24.PRO", "text": "Free Forex Signals (Android App) Bitcoin BTC/USD are traded at 8180 and continue to move in the fall.

Total 24-hour trade volume for today’s trading session is around $22.6B worth of exchanges. Bitcoin Cash markets have lost a bit of value since yesterday as the network experienced an upgrade which increased its block size to 32MB. BCH trade volume is thinner than the week prior as only $1Bn has been traded during the last day. The top five exchanges swapping the most BCH during today’s trading sessions are Okex, Bitfinex, Huobi, Upbit, and Hitbtc. Both the South Korean won and tether (USDT) BCH trading pairs have seen exponential volumes but BTC still dominates pairs by 34 percent. The BCH/BTC pair is followed by tether (USDT 25.4%), USD (22%), KRW (14%), and the EUR (1.4%). BCH/USD market action on May 16, 2018, according to Satoshi Pulse. BCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the four-hour BCH/USD chart on Bitfinex the price is seeing some deep triangular consolidation at the moment. The MACd is on the rise after the initial dip took place and show more improvement could be in the cards. RSI levels show the oscillator is around 38 right now, showing oversold conditions seem imminent. Looking at the two Simple Moving Averages indicates the path to resistance to the upside still looks obtainable as the short term 100 SMA rides above the longer term 200 SMA trend line. Looking at order books on the upside, BCH bulls need to muster up the strength to break past $1,330-1,355 in order to make headway northbound. On the flipside, if the dips continue there are some solid foundations between the current vantage point and $1,210. Bitfinex — BCH/USD May 16, 2018, at 10 am EDT. A Brief Glimpse at Overall Cryptocurrency Market Action\nThe entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is seeing pretty decent losses today even though there’s been loads of good news coming from the industry this week. The number one cryptocurrency market cap held by Bitcoin Core (BTC) is wavering just below the $8,400 region with $7Bn in trade volume over the past 24-hours. Ethereum (ETH) markets has seen some dippage as well, as prices have lost 4 percent today. One ETH is hovering just above $700 USD at the time of publication. Ripple (XRP) markets are seeing heavier losses around 6.3 percent as one XRP is $0.69 cents today. Lastly, the fifth highest capitalization has been a contested position for a while now as many coins have been filling this area over the past year. EOS has held the number five spot for a few weeks now but its markets are down 11.7 percent today as one EOS is averaging $12 per coin. The top ten cryptocurrencies today according to Satoshi Pulse. The Verdict: Mid-May Market Action is Lackluster but Positivity Remains\nSo far, the mid-May bull run lots of enthusiasts were hoping for has been nothing but a fizzle this week. Many believed cryptocurrencies would begin to see larger gains after the Consensus conference in New York started but that forecast never came to fruition, at least not yet. The only coins that are doing well today are a few miscellaneous tokens and stablecoins like tether (USD, and TrueUSD showing traders are likely using these ‘stable’ currencies as shelter from the current storm). Optimism and positivity among traders on social media and trader groups on Telegram still seems bright, even though markets have shaved some decent gains over the past 72-hours.\nWhere do you see the price of BCH and other cryptocurrencies headed from here?

How to Use Social Media to Dominate Google's Search Results | Ep. #646 In episode #646, Eric and Neil discuss how you can use social media to dominate Google’s search results. Tune in to hear how you can leverage social media to rank higher in Google. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Use Social Media to Dominate Google's Search Results [00:40] You have to create a lot of content. [00:50] You can use social media to rank for your brand, but also for a lot of other keywords or terms. [00:56] If you search for anything, Google will also bring up Twitter results. [01:30] By participating in all social media sites, you can show up for everything! [01:45] Eric helped an alarm company push up the results for their social profiles and buried their one negative Forbes review. [02:35] Link to your social profiles from your website. [02:52] The domain authority to these sites is so high already, that Google will push the results higher. [03:08] Participate actively on social media. [03:24] Make sure you engage other users on social media. [03:48] Listen to Eric and Neil’s episode about getting your social media profiles up and running/link building. [04:00] Make sure you cross-promote your social profiles once per month. [04:20] Get personal: social is meant to be about you. Talk about your team instead of the product.

Tune in to hear what will become of SEO next year and how you can adapt. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: [00:38] SEO is heading towards voice search. [00:40] However, it’s not just SEO, it’s the world. Consider Amazon’s “Alexa”. [01:03] Search is changing, because people will ask an AI assistant as opposed to Googling. [01:56] There is a tool that was developed to help with semantic searches. [02:08] It looks for the meaning of what you are looking for (ex. What is love? And it will produce results that offer resources to answer that question). [02:50] AI and semantic searches are melding together. [03:09] Alexa the product is better at SEO, but the voice device outranks it. [03:25] Mobile is huge now. [03:33] If you are using a mobile phone, the search index you see is different than what you would get on a desktop. [03:50] It’s unclear how to monetize voice search thus far. [04:04] You need to be there, so once it’s monetized, you can jump on it. [04:46] Eric and Neil now have their podcast on Alexa and they are getting more listens. [05:20] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why and how you should diversify your efforts. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: You Should Never Rely on SEO or Social Media Marketing [00:35] With social media sites, you are never in full control of your own destiny and you never want to put that in someone else’s hands. [01:00] Paid ads are great, but costs can go up or you can get banned. [01:26] Leverage SEO and Social, but you also need to diversify into things like paid advertising, email marketing, etc. [02:04] Be patient, get ONE thing working before you diversify. [02:47] When relying on social media channels, take your profits and diversify as quickly as possible. [03:05] Spend the money earlier on. [03:20] Once you have that multi-channel approach, make sure you are creating really high quality content. [04:00] Slow and steady wins the race with SEO. [04:11] It takes time and money to create great content. [04:44] Going for short-term hacks will screw you in the long run. [05:14] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear which marketing tools are free or low cost and still get the job done. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Best Marketing Tools For Under $100 [00:33] Eric likes BuzzSumo, because it lets you track your brand, certain keywords, and traffic coming into your site. [00:56] Neil likes SpyFu. It’s not as popular as SEMrush and AHREFS, but it’s a lot less expensive and has a lot of good data. You get similar results, so if you can’t afford the other services, this is a great option. [01:16] Wistia has a good free version you can use to make and post videos. [01:50] Sumo is a great way to collect emails and remarket to people. It’s an all-in-one free tool. [02:18] Frame.io streamlines the video-making process. It may run you over $100/year. [02:42] Survey Monkey is a great tool to help you get feedback from your customers; this is a way to qualitative data. [03:14] For heat mapping, Crazy Egg can’t be beat. [03:26] Convert Kit is for email blasts. While it doesn’t have full automation, it’s a useful and easy-to-use tool for marketers. [04:29] You don’t have to pay for these tools every month. Sometimes, you can use the free option and always upgrade for a month at a time. [04:40] That’s it for today! [04:50] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear which social network you should be leveraging and what tactics you need to use. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Social Network That'll Drive You More Traffic Than Facebook [00:36] The social network that will get you more traffic than Facebook is LinkedIn! [00:45] It’s not popular, but it works better. [01:05] After the Microsoft acquisition, LinkedIn has stepped up their game. [01:14] When you post on LinkedIn, the post stays up longer and you get more engagement. [01:27] Facebook can do whatever they want, while LinkedIn is starving for content and needs to compete. [02:02] If you want organic traffic, use LinkedIn. [02:12] When Neil posts a video on LinkedIn, he gets anywhere from twice to seven times as many views as he would on Facebook. [03:03] To succeed on LinkedIn: take your video content and put it on LinkedIn. [03:11] To succeed on LinkedIn: Take the audio from your video content, turn it into a podcast and post on LinkedIn. [03:33] To succeed on LinkedIn: Post your blog posts on LinkedIn. [03:45] However, with blog posts you should put the title, first two paragraphs, and then a link to your site for the rest. [04:01] Engage with other groups and members. [04:16] That’s it for today! [04:20] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear how you can increase your traffic and conversions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Simplest Way to Bring People Back to Your Website [00:55] You either collect emails or get them to opt into push notifications. Then you have to continually urge them back to your site. [01:10] You can also get people to follow your social profiles, but they don’t convert. [02:00] Subscribers is a great email service, but you can also use ManyChat to push people back to your site. [02:40] Try retargeting, as well. Google Retargeting and you will probably come across Neil. [03:07] It is just putting a pixel on your site that alerts ad networks and lets them track visitors. This will then allow ad networks to spot your visitors and post relevant ads in their browser that will send them back to your site. [03:20] However, retargeting is expensive. [03:27] Neil agrees that email is a great technique and likes Mobile Monkey. [03:45] It’s harder to get traffic from Facebook ads now, so you should leverage sure things like email and chatbot marketing. [03:53] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear what one tactic you should be leveraging. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Marketing Tactic You Must Master in 2018 [00:33] Surprise: it’s branding! [00:49] Neil recently performed a survey to discover what causes people to engage with his brand. [00:57] He made sure it was an open-ended survey. [01:05] The answers were either that they saw him at a conference or watched his videos. [01:55] The reason Eric and Neil simulcast their podcasts on video is because people enjoy and engage with the videos more. [02:14] Even though it costs more upfront, it will pay off financially in the long run. [03:00] The market is very fragmented right now; the way people market and engage with content varies. [03:38] Make sure that you spread your content across the many different social media platforms, because you will reach different people on each one. [04:35] There are a lot of websites that get a lot of traffic, but bring in little revenue; so, Neil’s company has been buying them out in order to pick up the traffic. [05:10] That’s it for today!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Three Best Marketing Strategies [00:46] Posting less on Facebook, actually gets you more traffic. [01:14] Share your best pieces and you will get higher engagement. [01:40] Eric’s office has printed out and posted the Content Re-usage Workflow. [02:00] The framework says to start with a foundation, which will then give you options to spin the content down the line. [02:54] Google Analytics can now show you each person’s entrypoint to your site and what is causing a conversion. [03:05] Take the conversion data and take the low click-rate stuff and repurpose it.

Tune in to hear how many different facets go into creating a successful business. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Small Things Make The Biggest Difference [00:36] At a past job, Eric took the footer links on the homepage and added more that said “Learn Web Design” and “Learn Web Development”. These small changes helped to improve the domain authority. [01:23] The Dropbox referral program isn’t what made their company, even though it helped. [01:35] Their explainer video was also a small thing that helped make a difference without making the only difference. [02:00] Dropbox offered a lot of little things to help create the powerhouse they are today. [02:15] It’s never just one thing, but rather a lot of little things that make up a successful company. [02:45] It’s like a video game: you are constantly leveling up. [03:38] Think about building things up, but remember not to do it in isolation. [04:00] Figure out how you can do one small marketing thing each and every week. [04:05] Even though you won't’ necessarily see the results every week, it will pay off in the near future. [04:20] When Eric started at Single Grain, the web traffic was 4000/month. Now, it is 100,000+/month. [04:30] This improvement was made over the course of four years. [04:41] Never expect immediate results. [05:16] Eric remembers grinding away until he got results. [05:44] It’s all about the journey! [06:06] For the first year that Eric was podcasting Growth Everywhere, he would spend six hours putting together all the facets of creating and uploading an episode. [06:17] He only got 9 downloads per day, but kept grinding away until he got more listeners. [06:30] Now, they get 80,000 listeners. [06:44] There was no one thing that made the podcast big, it was a combination of factors. [06:48] That’s all for today! [06:49] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear why you should be focused more energy on paid ads. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: SEO Will Never be as Good as Paid Ads! [00:34] Content pages generally rank higher than product pages. [00:59] While paid ads are expensive, you can direct traffic to pages that will generate the most cash. [01:10] The conversion rate is higher, because visitors will land on a page that is selling them something. [01:29] You just can’t control SEO as well as you can paid ads. [01:57] With paid ads, you can scale as much as you need to. [02:20] VC’s really like pouring money into SaaS companies. [02:44] Google and Facebook wouldn’t be worth what they are, if it wasn’t for paid ads. [03:30] People are moving campaigns from TV to the Internet. [04:05] Focus on paid ads before SEO, especially if you have a product or service. [04:34] That’s it for today! [04:37] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Connect with us: NeilPatel.com Quick Sprout Growth Everywhere Single Grain Twitter @neilpatel Twitter @ericosiu Is It Worth Spending $200 Per Blog Post? | Ep. #636 In episode #636, Eric and Neil discuss whether it is worth spending money on blog posts. Tune in to hear where your money should be going. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Is It Worth Spending $200 Per Blog Post? [00:33] Yes, it is worth the money! [00:45] The cost per blog depends on the industry. [00:50] It’s not about how much you pay, but rather if it is on the right topic, using the right keywords, etc. [01:05] You can’t be pushing or schilling in the post, it needs to educate. [01;20] Neil writes long-form blog posts. [01:40] It costs him well over $200 per blog post. [02:05] Start with a strong foundation and build from there (videos, webinars, facebook ads). [02:23] Singlegrain went from 4000 visitors per month to over 100,000 by using this strategy. [03:15] Every quarter, open up a tool like AHREFS, see the keywords for which you rank well and improve upon them or replicate that content. [04:01] Once you build a strong blog foundation, you can expand into other areas of media. However, don’t neglect your blog posts as a result. [04:15] You will get higher ROI by fixing up old content. [04:42] Clickflow is a tool to help you figure all this out. [04:58] If you spend money on a post, remember that it keeps generating traffic each and every month. [05:18] Google “Tom Tunguz and compound marketing” and you will get a great blog post about this very subject. [05:41] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear what you may have been overlooking. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 95% of You Will Ignore This SEO Strategy [00:36] Branding is what separates good companies from the bad. [01:30] If you don’t know how popular a brand is, it’s hard to outrank them. [02:00] Neil’s strategy used to be: create good content, create value, wait for results. [02:04] This wasn’t the best strategy. [02:15] His best branding strategy was the “Who is Neil Patel?” campaign. [02:45] BuzzSumo has a great alert system that will help you track your brand. [02:51] Neil likes to use Google Trends, which is free. [03:03] Google Search Console is also a great way to track your progress. [03:10] GSC tracks farther back than 90 days, which is more helpful when gauging progress. [04:15] The stronger your brand, the higher your domain authority. [04:40] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why experiments are key. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Straightest Road to Success [00:33] The key to success is experimentation! [00:51] A lot of people forget to build out an experimentation framework. [01:02] Neil will split his team into four groups and each group will submit ideas each week for “crazy” experiments they can run. [02:38] Each group needs to run experiments every week. [02:46] GrowthHackers created North Star, which helps you track experiments over time. [03:00] Northstar is a free service. [03:18] Try Google Experiments as another tracker. [03:34] Build experimentation into the fabric of your company. [04:00] It’s ok if experiments fail! [04:28] By doing radical experiments, you can learn how to grow your company at a fast pace. [04:50] Read Crazy Egg to learn more about experimentation. [05:01] That’s all for today! [05:04] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear what you should love in order to be successful. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Don't Fall in Love With an Idea [00:35] Most startups start with a totally different idea than what they are doing presently. [00:54] Don’t fall in love with an idea, fall in love with an industry. [01:55] As long as you stick with your industry, you can build upon that experience, as opposed to shifting to something else entirely. [02:18] It’s like compound interest: the moment you stop investing, you lose all that interest. [02:53] Stay in your lane. [03:01] In a Nathan Latka podcast interview, the discussion was about sticking with one industry instead of branching out into the unknown. [04:02] You need to love what you do, but make sure you love the industry. [04:20] Elon Musk had ZipTo, then Paypal, then SpaceX. Because he jumped industries, he struggled much longer before his success. [05:23] It’s like WOW: you need to keep levelling up. [06:00] That’s all for today!

Tune in to see why past techniques may not work for you today. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Stop Copying Your Competition [00:38] What worked for your competition won’t necessarily work for you. [01:17] The problem with content marketing is that there is now a lot more competition. [01:40] Whereas Neil had success within the first three months, it would take people a year to do the same today. [02:18] Costs of paid ads have gone up and bigger brands drive prices even higher. [03:00] What people were willing to spend years ago, was a lot less than you would have to spend today. [04:00] Just because one tactic worked for another company, doesn’t mean it will work the same way for you. [04:15] Dropbox referral programs worked in the past, but they probably wouldn’t work now. [04:50] If you’re in business to make money, you should do something else. [05:03] You have to be three steps ahead of everyone; think about what will be popular in the future. Spot trends. [05:40] Take chances and shoot for the moon. [05:50] That’s all for today! [05:53] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear why overthinking could be ruining your business. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Don't Overthink Shit [00:34] Everyone loves to come up with complex funnels. [00:48] When you make it complex, stuff is more likely to break down. [01:12] Start simple, then expand. [01:22] When Eric started, his channel was SEO. They wrote content and did a lot of guest posting. [01:43] They tried a complex marketing funnel, but it didn’t work. [01:55] They also were podcasting at the same time and then layered in content marketing once they got the hang of everything. [02:27] Just focus on the things that you are good at. [02:40] Don’t take on too much and you can layer things in later. [03:14] Why build a crazy marketing/sales funnel, when you haven’t tried a simple one in order to see if it would even work? [03:50] The boring growth is often the most sustainable growth. [05:06] Wait until the next marketing method has been effective and monetized by others, then jump on the bandwagon. You don’t have to be the first! [05:33] That’s all for today! [05:36] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway! Leave some feedback: What should we talk about next?

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to become a more successful marketer. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How Successful Marketers Think [00:35] Successful marketers are numb to failure. [00:45] Most experiments are going to fail, but as long as you continue to improve by 1%/week, that will be a 50% gain over the course of a year. [01:13] Consistency is key! [01:20] It takes time to get things right, but you have to stay the course. [01:45] Eric writes thousands of blog posts, even though he has terrible grammar. He knows it is important to follow through and be consistent. [01:50] Be a T-shaped marketer. [02:30] Spot trends! If you are not good at spotting trends, keep reading news sites and stay on top of things. [03:25] Things change so quickly in marketing. [04:45] If you are not thinking about ROI, you are not going to succeed in the marketing world. [05:20] It’s important to be data-driven; the numbers do not lie. [05:59] Don’t be afraid to shake up whatever industry you are in. [06:12] Neil is willing to do this by taking competitors products or services, copying them, and then offering them for free.

Tune in to hear what’s changed and how you can get a successful start doing SEO. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Start in SEO [00:45] The biggest thing that Eric and Neil are seeing right now is that the path to success has changed. [01:18] If you spend a year practicing SEO on your own website, that’s no longer the way to go. [01:35] You should practice on someone else’s older website. [01:52] Hit up a ton of people offering your services for free. [02:00] It’s easier to grow a business than it is to start one. [02:25] During a TED Talk Eric saw, a Harvard Professor outlined the three elements of trust: authenticity, empathy, and logic. [02:45] When you develop your skills for free, you will eventually earn clients. [03:14] You will probably have to email 15-17 people before you get a solid “yes” when it comes to offering your services for free. [03:40] Make sure that the person to whom you offer your services is as committed as you are. [03:59] Even if you are working for free, make sure you get a contract to get the time that you need. [04:38] A semantic search tool was just released from a developer at Google. [04:57] Be aware that this is the future of searching and it will affect your SEO. [05:42] SEO and Sales are similar. [05:58] SEO is trying to sell yourself and get a link. [06:04] Victor Antonio has a great YouTube page about sales. [06:24] Most new SEO workers focus on traffic from relevant keywords, which Neil thinks is a terrible idea. [06:37] Just because you get more relevant traffic, doesn’t mean you get more sales. [06:50] Instead, look at Google Analytics, see where your ROI is coming from, focus on increasing traffic to the landing pages with the most revenue. [07:21] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why you should always focus on long-term goals and solutions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 6 Minutes For the Next 60 Years of Your Entrepreneurial Journey [00:36] When you think about starting a business, most people think about “what problem should I solve?” [00:54] But you should also ask “will this problem that I’m solving still be relevant in the ensuing years?” [01:08] You don’t want to have to create a new business every few years. [01:30] Eric thinks Singlegrain will still be around in 20 years, but that it will have to evolve. [02:10] Five years into his business, Eric believes he still has a long way to go. [02:36] If you come up with a short-sighted solution, then you will have to start a new business every few years. It is easier to grow a business than it is to start one. [03:00] Elon Musk has a long-term plan to work towards getting people on Mars. [04:07] Often times, the most difficult problems to solve are also the most boring, but the boring stuff stands the test of time. [05:00] Neil believes marketing will always be around as a industry. [05:45] Focus on your strengths and then see how you can expand upon that. [06:10] Do the boring stuff! [06:36] Don’t focus on the short-term solutions or businesses. [06:53] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to grab your next successful CMO. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Find a CMO [00:33] They get hit up all the time for people looking to fill this position, but it is the hardest position to fill. [00:55] Tap into referral networks. [01:05] When Eric was hired at Treehouse, he was referred in. [01:27] Don’t just hire a CMO, have someone prove in a lesser position that they can deliver results for you. Have people work their way up. [02:55] Instead of having a CMO, just make the marketing department work together to guide the mission. [03:41] Contingency firms whose focus is on hiring executives is another way to go. [03:48] They will cost you a lot of money, but will deliver on the mission. [04:34] Org structures are different now, so it changes how you can operate. [04:38] To recap: referral networks work, contingency firms work, having NO CMO works. [04:48] That’s it for today! [04:50] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear what you should actually be focusing on! TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: To Focus or Not to Focus, The Marketer's Dilemma [00:50] People have different concepts of how marketing works. [01:02] Your tactics all depend on what your business is, what its status is, etc. [01:37] Pick a tactic that is working the best for you and focus all your energy on that. [01:55] Once that tactic is operating to its best abilities, add in other tactics. [02:24] Eric worked at a company that tried a bunch of different tactics and found video marketing worked the best, then focused all their energy on that. [03:14] Neil met the Legal Zoom/Shoedazzle CEO; he told Neil to have laser focus. [04:10] Steve Jobs said that he is better at saying “no” than other people. [04:40] If your growth rate is accelerating, hit the gas. If it’s decelerating, think about what you can improve. [04:55] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear why television news is a waste of your time. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Why We Don't Watch The News [00:33] The news media is just another business. [00:45] It’s a viewership-driven business and they thrive on ad revenue. [01:00] Instead, Eric follows different people on Twitter and gets his news from that. [01:20] TV news is just noise! [02:21] You can get your news by browsing news sites instead. [02:34] If something really important or big happens, you will most likely find out about it on Twitter or social media, anyway. [03:15] By not spending time posting on social media, you gain a lot of hours back. [03:44] To beat your competition, focus on your business and what matters as opposed to being obsessed with frivolous social media posts. [04:40] The Economist Espresso is one or two paragraphs and summarizes the most important stories. [05:00] “If you want to do well, stop wasting your time” -Neil [05:07] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear how you should be organizing your life. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Get More Out of Your Day [00:40] Google “Michael Hyatt Perfect Day”, which will explain how to block out your day. [00:53] Eric and Neil record at a set time every week. [01:07] Thursdays are Eric’s content days. Fridays are for his SAS products. [02:05] Eric will do networking events, dinners, etc., because it is a priority for growing his business. [02:40] Figure out your end goal and cut everything else out. [03:00] Neil doesn’t do networking events, rather he does actual tasks. [03:15] He feels that if he hasn’t accomplished his goals, he can’t rest, so he doesn’t care about work/life balance: he works through illnesses and holidays. [03:29] Mark Schuster did a blog post “Learning Before Earning”, which you should read. [04:09] The book, The One Thing, tells you to pick your most important goal and to just focus on that. [05:06] Building or fostering good habits is key. [05:15] You have to rank things to determine which is the most urgent/important. [05:42] Check out Rescue Time: It will show you how you are spending your time and allow you to cut the fat. [06:15] Delegate! [07:10] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to remain popular. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Here's A Unique Way To Keep Your Brand Top Of Mind [00:38] If you look at Drift, every time they launch a new feature, they always have a lot of fanfare and masquerade it as a product launch. [01:26] In 2017, Neil bought UberSuggest and relaunched it as a free tool in 2018. [01:45] He used Product Hunt to promote it. [02:15] Neil publishes to his blog 7 days a week! [02:32] You have to be relentless in order to stay top of mind. Tom Brady is a great example of relentlessness. [03:00] There is no one specific thing you can do to stay popular, but rather you have to try everything. [03:42] The rule of 7: someone has to see something 7 times before they convert. [04:10] By putting yourself out there, eventually, you will become top of mind. [04:51] Zoom doesn’t run a lot of ads, but they have billboards everywhere in San Francisco. They even bought a sponsorship at the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. [05:28] That’s all for today! [05:31] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Running Out of Marketing Ideas? Do this [00:45] Eric opens Feedly, which has a bunch of marketing blogs, which can give him a bunch of ideas. [01:17] Nuzzle takes all of his Twitter followers and shows him who they are following. [01:34] Basically, go out and research in order to get new ideas. [01:47] Instead of doing more things, improve what you are already doing. [01:53] Try using Buzzsumo, SEMRush, AHREFS in order to see what your competitors are doing. [02:14] Re-write your competitors work and improve upon it. [02:46] Whatrunswhere shows you what banner ads your competitors are leveraging. [03:15] Keep things fresh: go look at your channels and update/upgrade them. [03:42] Crowdsource your ideas! [04:50] Listen to competitors’ podcasts, which will give you great ideas. Find out their numbers, see what’s working, and leverage this information to your advantage. [05:32] Eric did an episode of Growth Everywhere and his interviewee’s competitor was listening and reached out to Eric.

Tune in to hear how you can decipher a bullshitter from a talented marketer. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Marketers Are Full of Shit [00:34] Marketers always talk a big game, but their results speak for themselves. [01:08] When hiring marketers, make sure whatever they claim to have done is backed up by proof. [01:45] Eric’s friend had to fire his marketing guy, because the marketer used up too many resources. [02:16] You must absolutely require proof of success and pay them for a trial period (run a series of paid tests). [02:48] Always test out a working relationship before you pull the trigger. [03:20] Neil doesn’t care what your title is, he is only focused on efficacy and results. [03:43] Eric and Neil can easily provide proof of their results. [04:05] “What is the most impressive win of your marketing career thus far?” is Eric’s favorite interview question. Once you start pressing for details, you can tell whether a candidate is lying. [04:40] Neil likes to show candidates his website and ask what they would do to fix any issues. [05:05] This is a great way to see if they can think on their feet or improve upon anything. It shows you if they know what they are talking about. [05:41] That’s all for today! [05:43] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Eric and Neil discuss 7 unorthodox marketing hacks. Tune in to hear what you could be doing to drive conversions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 7 Unorthodox Marketing Hacks You Ought to Leverage [00:35] #1: When driving people to your website, less than 5% will convert. For the 95% that don’t convert, re-market them with an opposite pitch (logical vs. emotional). [01:22] #2: Every month, when Drift launches a new feature, they treat it as a product launch, which helps to keep them top-of-mind. Product Hunt is a great tool for this. [02:22] #3: There is a program on LinkedIn that gives a special button that populates their LinkedIn info into a form, so they have less work to do. This will increase your leads and conversions, because there is less work to be done [02:59] #4: Build a repurposing framework. Think about all the content you can take even further (turning a blog post into a video, social media post, webinar, etc.). [03:36] #5: To increase your traffic, start doing things people wouldn’t normally do. [04:01] The best way to get people from your blog to your landing page/product page is to place banner ads within your blog. [04:27] #6: Offer something for free for the cost of shipping. [04:57] Russell Brunson built his company by doing this. [05:10] #7: Give people options in your ads. [05:22] Within the first 30 seconds of a video about learning guitar, the instructor offered a link for beginners and a link for more advanced students. [06:04] That’s it for today!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Audit Your Content in 5 Minutes [00:34] Eric likes to use Screaming Frog Spider, an SEO tool that allows him to crawl his website like a search engine would. [01:06] There’s an annual fee, but it’s a great way to audit your content. [01:12] Neil likes to make a list of all his Wordpress content, see which topics are duplicates, then plugs that into Google Search Console. Once he sees which ones are ranking, he will combine the similar posts and update his links. [02:04] This is the quickest way to audit your content and this will increase your rankings. [03:05] Using a tool like AHREFS allows you to do content gap analysis, while also offering a look at your competitors. [03:25] Content auditing doesn’t take long!

Tune in to hear why you shouldn’t hire a Harvard grad. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Why You Shouldn't Hire Harvard Graduates [00:35] People who come from Ivy League schools are smart and they are not saying not to hire them. [01:20] What you need to do, is hire people based on how creative they are and their past work. [01:38] If a candidate can turn a dud into a stud, they can probably do great work for you. [01:55] People who go to good schools are good at following instructions. When it comes to getting creative and thinking outside the box, they may not be able to do that. [02:40] When Eric was 22, there was a Harvard grad who was in the same position as Eric. The Harvard grad appeared to have no chutzpah and would come in and only do what he was told. This motivated Eric to work hard and be creative. [03:25] Affiliate marketers are the most creative, because they don’t operate based on rules. [04:15] People that operate outside boundaries and make difficult numbers work, are often successful affiliate marketers. [04:36] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what plugins you should be using to optimize your posts. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Our Favorite Marketing WordPress Plugins of 2018 [00:35] YouTube Subscribe Bar allows you to embed videos and include a subscribe button. However, the subscribe button will subscribe viewers to your channel instead of the channel from which the video was posted. [01:13] Yoast SEO Plugin has an XML sitemap generator. They create XML sitemaps the correct way, whereas other plugins do not. [01:37] Tools like Pretty Links help to shorten links and make them more visually appealing.

We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we're talking about and measure our performance.\"\n\"We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,\" he continued. \"A nd just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\"\nBitcoin was priced around $8,300 Wednesday evening, 5:30 p.m. ET. While the coin has recovered from lows earlier this year — briefly dropping below $6,000 in February — bitcoin is still far away from its mid-December peak around $19,500.\nCoinShares, an investment firm specializing in cryptocurrency , launched the world's first publicly traded bitcoin and ethereum fund.\nInvestors were optimistic that Blockchain Week New York and Monday's Consensus event would help boost the large-cap coin. But bitcoin has under-performed, down 5 percent since Monday.\nMasters pointed out that three years ago, the market and number of people interested in cryptocurrencies was very small. This week, however, more than 8,000 people showed up for Blockchain Week New York.\nIn fact, he said, bitcoin's life cycle \"is still very early.\"\n\"In derivatives, indices, pricing models and so on that go on around [building a financial system.] We're nowhere near that part yet,\" Masters said.\n\"We're not even at the part yet where I'd say institutional investors even started in commodities.

After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Follow him on Twitter @bitentrepreneur.\nIt’s another hard fork day! Today, Bitcoin Cash is creating a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits and added smart-contract functionality. This is the third hard fork that the Bitcoin Cash community has undergone in under a year, and declares their undeterred commitment to change whatever necessary to grow their blockchain’s transaction abilities. Bitcoin Cash strives to provide an inexpensive and fast medium of exchange for everyday payments.\nA ‘hard’ fork refers to software changes that require the creation of a new blockchain from a previous one, whereas ‘soft’ forks can impute software updates without the creation of a new blockchain. A hard fork therefore is only implemented when there needs to be changes made at the most fundamental level of the blockchain architecture: the consensus protocol layer.\nBitcoin Cash was born out of a hard fork with Bitcoin’s blockchain last summer. After much debate amongst various parties of the Bitcoin ecosystem over how to scale the Bitcoin network, a group of developers organized under the name ABC Bitcoin, wrote the code for a hard fork to create a new blockchain with 8MB block limits. On August 1st, this new code was implemented to copy the entire Bitcoin block history onto a new network to begin mining its own transactions separately, as a distinct currency and under different mining parameters. Bitcoin Cash promises to be a peer to peer cash system. This system should be popular in areas where the traditional financial system has been unable to reach the unbanked.\nIn the case of last summer’s hard fork, not only was a new blockchain created, but also a new coin was introduced to the market to represent value exchanged on this new transaction ledger. However, not all hard forks create new coins. For example, Bitcoin Cash hard forked again last November to fix their algorithm adjusting mining difficulty because the network was producing wildly fluctuating hash rates.\nTo patch the system, various developer teams running different clients on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain agreed to implement a hard fork where they all copied the old ledger onto a new chain, with the software updated, and abandoned the old chain. Although technically November was also a ‘hard’ fork, it was obviously very different than the previous split in community generating not only a new blockchain, but also a new network, and a new coin.\nAnother Bitcoin Cash hard fork took place on May 15 in an effort to quadruple the BCH block size and lay the groundwork for adding smart contracts. However, it shouldn’t be understated that blockchain developers, including Bitcoin Cash, treat hard forking with caution, it’s a delicate process with potentially serious financial consequences. Though while many in the community treat hard forking with outright fear, this is a key part of how Bitcoin Cash operates, so the Bitcoin Cash community is not afraid of hard forks.\nThis time around is more similar to the November hard fork, but slightly different. Today’s fork neither creates a new coin, nor does it correct an existing problem, but rather strictly innovates in two ways. The first major change is the tripling of the block size limit from 8 to 32 MB that is a forward-looking adjustment to accommodate greater transaction throughput per block. I feel better that this block size growth is occurring now, while the usage of Bitcoin Cash still has a ways to grow, rather than later when the network is at full throttle.\nThis the larger block size gives Bitcoin Cash some room to scale, something that other blockchains have been looking to tackle in other ways, e.g. Lightning Network and Proof of Stake. This makes Bitcoin Cash somewhat unique because it attempts to solve the scaling problem at the consensus protocol layer while maintaining the Proof of Work model.\nHowever, larger blocks won’t in effect grow the network in terms of usage. It does however provide the ability for unprecedented growth. Growth in usage depends not on the block size but more on the community and businesses supporting Bitcoin Cash. Products, services and merchant adoption are key. After the block-size increase, the next advancement that Bitcoin Cash is putting forward is to add new and re-enable old, previously inactivated, machine-scripting operation codes, or more simply ‘op-codes’, that give developers tools to create smart contracts.\nThese machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the Bitcoin Cash community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens. These are tokens that can be tagged in a specific way to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object.\nIt is hard to say what might come out from this new functionality, but if we base our assumptions on what Ethereum has been able to accomplish from its second layer implementations, then I believe it will give Bitcoin Cash a lot of space for creative and productive ideas to blossom. To that end, we will shall have to see what the developers of the Bitcoin Cash community do with these new functionalities, and if the market decides to settle in this newfound block size that has yet be driven to scale.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\nImages from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:10:10.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f415128408da43b32d99b7374c3166871c1c652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9z._cFRy7NFbB4g.EsMeAhNUddhCg_DCFifg.thd_gxeTRmlKSyk9iWeqBu0ZqAg38lbcPnNceIOF70EpNawdab46gXTEg8zvfePKj6gMOvG5yh2gk3sHb2Rb1PQGkdEP02seLGZrEc", "site_full": "www.moneytalkvillage.com", "site": "moneytalkvillage.com", "site_section": "http://www.moneytalkvillage.com/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "MoneyTalkVillage", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "title_full": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "published": "2018-05-16T02:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f415128408da43b32d99b7374c3166871c1c652", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9z._cFRy7NFbB4g.EsMeAhNUddhCg_DCFifg.thd_gxeTRmlKSyk9iWeqBu0ZqAg38lbcPnNceIOF70EpNawdab46gXTEg8zvfePKj6gMOvG5yh2gk3sHb2Rb1PQGkdEP02seLGZrEc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Billy Wright", "published": "2018-05-16T02:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "text": "Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts [ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io Finally, you find first reliable Bitcoin Doubler that really works as it has to be.

Juthica Chou, Chief Operating Officer at LedgerX said: “Everything we do requires both the licenses. And a lot of that is intentional, because by making it a package deal we can offer a number of services to our customers in a really clear, vertically integrated way.”\nThe licenses permit users to earn a yield on their Bitcoin assets. Rather than just “hodling” and hoping that Bitcoin appreciates, investors can earn a fiat-based yield on their BTC by employing what is referred to as a call overwrite technique, wherein an investor deposits BTC into LedgerX, then sells a call option at a slightly longer date, with a higher strike call option.\nThe project is designed to simplify BTC option trading to a basic point-and-click format, so “less sophisticated” bull traders can potentially get a premium price on their holdings. The product’s interface allows users to choose the implied rate they’re anticipating to earn and the number of BTC they wish to earn the yield on. Chou said:\n“This interface will definitely be skewed to the long Bitcoin holders, who will likely only deposit bitcoin and who will want to earn interest off of that Bitcoin.”\nAccording to Forbes, during the past three months, 70 percent of the trade volume of LedgerX has come from options, with an average trade size of $60,000. The options contracts will reportedly be available for a three-month and a six-month duration, while LedgerX charges a transaction fee for each service.\nYesterday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched an Ethereum reference rate and real time index to the US dollar.

Police have started probe on the basis of transaction history.\nAccording to investigators, Mukund Patel, a resident of Shahibaug, owns Eminent Colours at Samrat Complex on CG Road. Three years ago, he had come in contact with Mehul Puraniya , a resident of Naranpura, through an acquaintance. In 2017, he had to sell 10 bitcoins. However, for the transaction, he needed another digital wallet. It would have taken some time before his account’s KYC process gets over and thus Patel got in touch with Puraniya, who had three wallets, for transfer of cryptocurrency.\n“According to the complaint, Puraniya provided keys of his three wallets after which Patel transferred 10 Bitcoins to different accounts. At that time, the value of one Bitcoin was Rs 2.92 lakh. After some time, Puraniya informed Patel that 2.56 Bitcoins were sold for Rs 7.49 lakh and he also sent a screenshot of the transaction. Soon after, Puraniya severed all contact,” said an investigator.\nOn the basis of probe, Patel got to know that the wallets used by Puraniya were in the name of Bhavik and Mehul Puraniya and Viral Bhanushali.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company’s co-chair Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment.

Wright (which is underway in a West Palm Beach, Florida, federal court) makes a bombshell claim.\nThe lawsuit now argues that Craig Wright recently lied about his supposed lack of connections to a Florida-based bitcoin-related company. Wright apparently co-founded and co-owned the company with a now-deceased Florida man who had a significant role in the early days of bitcoin: Dave Kleiman.

Having studied the most liquid websites-bitcoin trading on which bitcoins are traded I was struck by what big spread happens between them!In working with this strategy, you can either do everything actively, and constantly juggle money and bitcoins between exchanges, or sit passively and wait for the spread to diverge and converge in the direction you need in this situation, you spend less on transactions, spend less effort on the transfer of money between exchanges, and thus save on costs). But it is not a fact that when you work passively, you will earn more than if you trade actively and constantly maintain an even balance between exchanges. Another option to earn – is to buy powerful panic failures while they are bought back . In the last month of the failures happened 4 times and each time they grow back, this motion was 25-40% in less than a day. But this does not mean that the situation will repeat for the 5th time. Good luck! Hope you have time to make money on it! I’d be interested to read about your experience. Write the questions! And not in a hurry to rush into this. If there are any doubts, then first learn everything and watch at least a week for the schedule of bitcoins. 82199", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:57:16.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5d9cbbdf6a5944705ef8d2a8e9379e0de398451", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ.P.O_MIzogoEQ2P3MPG6k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Why u love bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why u love bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-16T01:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5d9cbbdf6a5944705ef8d2a8e9379e0de398451", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ.P.O_MIzogoEQ2P3MPG6k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitexpert2017", "published": "2018-05-16T01:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why u love bitcoin?", "text": "I love bitcoin because it gives me financial freedom.
