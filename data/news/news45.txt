Dorsey spoke at two events in March and May , where he predicted that Bitcoin would become the international currency of choice by 2028.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak explained.\nWozniak reiterated that he is “not an investor,” having originally purchased Bitcoin at $700 to experiment with its use as a means of payment. “I have one Bitcoin and two ether ,” he told CNBC. Nonetheless, for Wozniak, Bitcoin represents a separate class of crypto asset to all others:\n“Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control.

According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered ‘pure.’ Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency\nIn an interview with CNBC on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam:\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.”\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey’s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square stated that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin.\nAccording to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He’d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was defrauded out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins – the native currency on the Ethereum network.\nIn the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn’t require human intervention to work:\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nFinally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment:\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

On the other hand, traditional investors like Warren Buffett see bitcoin as a highly speculative asset that is poisonous. But for many business owners, bitcoin can be the beginning of a financial evolution that can redefine your growth potential.\nBecause of the bitcoin craze of 2017, most people only see bitcoin as an investment opportunity. But it’s also a medium of exchange that many businesses are leveraging to provide buyers with more payment options. Overstock.com, Subway, Microsoft, Intuit, and Square are just a few of the businesses that are accepting bitcoin. Should your business be next?\nMany business owners are quick to dismiss anything they don’t understand. This mentality won’t work for businesses that want to remain competitive in a global marketplace. In order to be a sustainable and leading business in the 21st century, business owners should learn as much as they can about advancements that can impact how business is done. This is necessary to make an informed decision.\nIf you are thinking about accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, here’s what you should consider: Bitcoin is a Global Currency\nBitcoin can be accepted from anywhere in the world without exchanging it for the local country’s currency. As more governments accept bitcoin as legal tender, it has the potential to become the first major global currency. When businesses can easily accept currency from others around the world, it expands their consumer base. Bitcoin Adds Another Level of Security\nBitcoin is the first decentralized currency to hit the market, allowing a secure transaction that uses high-level encryption to eliminate currency counterfeiting. Some retailers such as Epic Burger and Argo Tea have gone as far as to ban cash payments to enhance their level of security. Businesses that are able to hold a small amount of cash on hand and make use of alternative payment sources are able to reduce their risk of theft. They also have an electronic trail to manage sales receipts. Bitcoin Speeds Up Processing Time\nBitcoin is one of the fastest payment solutions around because the transaction occurs between two parties: the seller and the buyer. This isn’t the case for credit card transactions. It takes several days for credit card settlements to occur because money must flow through at least three banks to complete the transaction. Using bitcoin as a form of payment allows you to eliminate third-party intermediaries and speed up the processing time.\nThere’s a lot for business owners to learn about cryptocurrency since it has only been in use by the general public since 2009. While cryptocurrency is making its way into mainstream conversations, business owners should take the time to consult with professionals who can help them understand what accepting bitcoin may mean for their business. The future is going toward digital payments anyway, so why not take advantage of opportunities to learn as much as you can now?

It is normal that the price of bitcoin gets down but it's been a long time since it is on its original value or higher than its real value. Those who invest these past few months are suffering a lot of loaaes and they are losing hope that bitcoin will continue to drastically decrease in value. Do you have guys some advice for me? It will be really appreciated and I will be eternal grateful.\nWell, do your stuffs as what you do when the market price isn't as low as this. Just continue to strive it up again, don't lose hope those like the other it won't be good to yourself mentally and financially and to the market as well. Just stay firm on holding it and buying it more. Once the market price rebuilds itself again and regain its last december 2017 it will be a guaranteed profit right there.

The goal is to attract more international tourists who prefer to pay for goods and services with digital currencies like bitcoin .\nAgnes Water-1770 . Source: Pixabay\nAccording to Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) , Gordon Christian, a local real estate agent was involved in the cryptocurrency movement. He mentioned to ABC that he won local business' support to bring the emerging technology to the Queensland town.\nABC reported on June 3, cryptocurrency groups and tourists from Japan will visit the Queensland town to aid them with their new cryptocurrency launch campaign.\nAustralian Town Leverages Cryptocurrency Movement to Boost Tourism Christian initially explored digital currencies when his client asked him about processing bitcoin payments from customers. When he realized that the Brisbane airport was accepting digital currency payments, he \"thought, this is something worth having a look at.\"\nThe local real estate agent managed to gain the support of over 2,000 permanent residents to explore cryptocurrencies. \"We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses, and they were straight on board… I guess they were international travelers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,\" said Christian. \"Initially, we had a good ten businesses that just said, 'Fine let's go for it.'\"\nThe idea to attract the \" digital traveler \" quickly took off within the community. \"So it started out as, well how would they get here? Could we provide a shuttle service to bring them from the airport or the railway station? Then [we considered], Where would they stay and what are they going to do when they get here?\"\nChristian added that 31 businesses from the Queensland town have signed up. These companies range from backpackers to resorts, tour companies, the local pub, restaurants, and even day spas.\nTravelbyBit Helps Companies Looking to Utilize Cryptocurrency Over time, there have been more brick and mortar retailers across Australia looking to accept digital currencies as a form of payment.\nQueensland startup TravelbyBit is aiding this new financial frontier by launching a point-of-sale application that helps businesses accept cryptocurrency payments. Just last week, the startup rolled out its cryptocurrency payment system at Brisbane airport , making Brisbane \"Australia's first digital currency-friendly airport.\"\n\"If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers,\" said Caleb Yeoh, TravelbyBit's CEO. \"Travelling with one global currency like bitcoin…makes sense. Blockchain has the ability to make transactions a lot more transparent and efficient…I think it's the way of the future.\"\nYeoh added that \"the town has made a very strategic move trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists…to come out to their little part of the woods. People who use cryptocurrency …it's a social movement, and they believe in it, and therefore they support places…who take it.

But on the other hand, it is reaping the dark side of the digital currency.\nI think Bitcoin is very useful for criminals who want to hide money from their crimes. Because if they save money in the bank, the money from the crime can be easily traced. Bitcoin can also be abused by people who want to hide their income from government, and avoid paying taxes. Then, the state revenue from the tax will be lost because of the money that is not tracked. Not only in the criminal acts alone, the most basic lack of Bitcoin also occurs because of its unreal form.\nNot to mention the instability of the value of Bitcoin currency if converted to other conventional currencies are very volatile. Today, maybe the owner can be very rich by having Bitcoin worth 1,000 US dollars. However, who knows if in the future the value of money is only left 50 US dollars.\nsome minor events that cause huge losses for Bitcoin owners. A man once lost about 600 US dollars for doing a reset on his smart phone and in fact, he accidentally permanently remove the Bitcoin digital wallet.\nA number of online platforms are testing the payment with Bitcoin currency, among others WordPress, Reddit, Namecheap, Mega, and Zynga. However, some countries even banned transactions with Bitcoin. The Chinese government, for example, forbids all financial institutions from receiving Bitcoin transactions. While the EU rate Bitcoin more easily stolen. In terms of investment is also bad because the currency is determined only based on market demand and has a high fluctuation rate.\nBitcoin have also its negative sides. First thing is its volatility. Well most of the time it is a good thing because that is where investors get their money but for short term tradera, it is bad for them when the bitcoin continuously goes down because they expect to have an income immediately. Also, bitcoin has high transaction fees that makes some investors bother when doing transactions because of worrying to the fees.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:14:18.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf93d07d9ea604f4bd43c80120e462d7d87428d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOOGcJ.wjO6aUnCbxFnJe7SiZiSjWzGSozzLNAehXj_ur22h3fvN9WlyppfQeFkuYdfI1UYg0n_3Wf1jHWzpcsQ4-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Inflation in Venezuela has now reached above 25,000%.

Dorsey spoke at two events in March and May , where he predicted that Bitcoin would become the international currency of choice by 2028.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak explained.\nWozniak reiterated that he is “not an investor,” having originally purchased Bitcoin at $700 to experiment with its use as a means of payment. “I have one Bitcoin and two ether ,” he told CNBC. Nonetheless, for Wozniak, Bitcoin represents a separate class of crypto asset to all others:\n“Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that.

It was his mentor Aniket who introduced him to cryptocurrencies for the very first time.\nThe concept was new for Moreno-Sanchez, but he found it interesting that a new way of sending payments over the internet could be developed. Since he came from a background of working and solving networking problems, the idea of a global decentralized currency appealed more to him.\nHe started learning more about bitcoin and blockchain and eventually, his first paper was addressed a security issue in IoT products. He has since contributed to 11 research papers mainly dealing with increasing privacy across cryptocurrency networks. Research Paper for CoinShuffle Released in 2014\nIn September 2014, Moreno-Sanchez along with his mentor Aniket Kate and another scholar Tim Ruffing authored a paper in which they proposed a new system to increase the privacy of users. The proposed idea, if implemented, would make it impossible for anyone to track the history of a coin or to conclude who the owner of each coin is.\nIt was stated, “In this paper, we propose CoinShuﬄe, a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to utilize Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner.” It was based on the accountable anonymous group communication protocol Dissent and claimed to be better than most previous attempts made to address this issue.\nSuppose there is one user sitting exactly at the every edge of an n-sided pentagon. Every user has one coin with him and he does not know who are the other users sitting next to him. All these users then randomly pass their coins in a predefined manner such that no user is left with his original coin. At the end, every user will have one coin but it will be different from the original coin he originally had.By mixing coins of several users and then transfers them a new set of coins from the mixed coins, CoinShuffle can achieve an improvement in privacy.\nPrevious attempts made to enhance the privacy of users by mixing coins would use a centralized server which would increase the risk of the network failing or getting tampered with. CoinShuffle, however, used a P2P mixing protocol that had no central server as it was mixing the coins among users who were doing the actual work. Limitations of CoinShuffle Led to CoinShuffle++\nThe idea to let users work and mix their coins with each other worked fine for a small set of users, but the problem grew when it was tested among large users, as it increased the time it took to perform the operations by each user in a linear fashion.\nMoreno-Sanchez says, “The system worked fine for a less number of users but it would take almost seven minutes if there were 50 users who were part of the network.”\nDue to this limitation, it was impossible to roll out a working model for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency’s blockchain would process several thousands of transactions every day among all its users.\nTo do away with the disadvantage, Moreno-Sanchez and his team envisioned CoinShuffle++, which modified the protocol slightly to change the linear nature and perform the operations all at once instead . Praising it, he said, “It would take us seven minutes with 50 users, but now it took us less than seven seconds even with 100 plus users.” ValueShuffle\nValueShuffle was then conceptualized in a research paper ‘Mixing Conﬁdential Transactions: Comprehensive Transaction Privacy for Bitcoin’ in 2017 and is an extension of CoinShuffle++. It successfully combines coin mixing, and two partial privacy solutions namely Stealth Addresses and Confidential Transactions (CT). Since with CoinShuffle++ the amounts were public, the shuffle required users to have the same numbers of bitcoins.\n“The combination of technologies provides the privacy guarantees of interest in Bitcoin. ValueShuﬄe ensures that no attacker observing the blockchain or the network, or even participating in the protocol, can link inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction created in an execution of ValueShuﬄe.”\nOnce CT is available on Bitcoin, ValueShuffle can be easily integrated, “…we can directly apply ValueShuffle, we not only get the performance of CoinShuffle++ but we also manage to hide the amounts being shuffled and certain other properties associated with CT,” Moreno-Sanchez remarked.\nOn his thoughts about the timeframe surrounding the implementation of CT, he said from a technical point of view, “there are not any technical challenges or disadvantages with CT, and I hope in the next few months it will be accepted and integrated.”\nMoreno-Sanchez is bullish on the future of bitcoin, saying that researchers are really interested in the protocol, it would become a widely adopted currency soon serving as an alternative for payments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pedro moreno-sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moreno-sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim ruffing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aniket kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aniket", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saarlan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:50:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8d266f2b245c815d6508cf836a88228c67f96e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfONKpwF9tG210hmc_9BbD72XR4o_3s1G.biLtnyrWLDmcezuBdRFYv7Po.oYWuxaWkA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "I went all in at Bitcoin Core", "title_full": "I went all in at Bitcoin Core : btc", "published": "2018-06-04T22:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8d266f2b245c815d6508cf836a88228c67f96e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfONKpwF9tG210hmc_9BbD72XR4o_3s1G.biLtnyrWLDmcezuBdRFYv7Po.oYWuxaWkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "maestro_7", "published": "2018-06-04T22:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "I went all in at Bitcoin Core", "text": "I swear to god this coin will hit 20$ this month.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nMost large businesses have been quick to realize the vast potential of the blockchain technology and are moving towards adopting it. Now, even the United States are catching up. New York state is planning to establish a task force to study the implications of digital currencies on the financial markets in New York. A few countries like Norway and Switzerland are toying with the idea of launching their own digital currency. Estonia had plans to establish a national cryptocurrency, Estcoin but had to shelve its proposal following an objection from the European Central Bank. While the launch of a US-based crypto ETF is still a distant dream, Huobi, the third largest crypto exchange in the world by trade volume has launched an ETF , based on its market index. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also announced plans to launch a $1 billion fund to invest in crypto startups. We believe that the globe is moving towards a greater adoption of cryptocurrencies, which should fuel the next leg of the rally. We want to take advantage of the current fall in the crypto markets to establish positions, however, we are waiting for the opportune time to invest. Let’s see if we can locate any buy setups today. BTC/USD Bitcoin rallied close to the 20-day EMA but could not break out of it. If it doesn’t stop at the current levels, it can fall to $7300 and below that it will retest $7100. The 20-day EMA acts as a resistance in a downtrend and acts as a support in an uptrend. Therefore, until the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it will remain negative and susceptible to selling pressure on any rally. The traders should wait for a dip below $7,000 or a breakout above the 20-day EMA to establish long positions. We don’t find any buy setups at the current levels; hence, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines. ETH/USD Ethereum is trading inside the descending channel, making lower lows and lower highs. The trend will change when the digital currency breaks this streak and makes a higher high and a higher low. From the support line of the channel on May 28, the digital currency rallied to the resistance line of the channel on June 03 but the bulls could not break out of the channel; hence, prices have again turned down today. If the next dip doesn’t break below the intraday low of May 28, it will be a positive sign. We suggest traders to wait for the ETH/USD pair to break out and close (UTC time frame) above the descending channel before initiating any long positions. Conversely, if the digital currency breaks below $492.5, it can again decline to the support line of the channel, close to $464. We didn’t find any buy setups at the current levels. XRP/USD Ripple bounced off the critical support at $0.56270 and scaled above the 20-day EMA but could not break out of the 50-day SMA. It continues to trade inside a descending triangle, which is a bearish sign. A break below the $0.54 level can extend the fall to $0.45. The first sign of strength will be when the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the $0.83 levels. Both moving averages are flattening out, which points to a range-bound action, rather than a trending move. We shall wait for a couple of days before suggesting any trade on it. BCH/USD We were expecting Bitcoin Cash to trade in a small range but we were proven wrong as it rallied for the past two days and came close to the 50-day SMA. The BCH/USD pair is turning down from just above $1,200 levels. It can take support at the 20-day EMA or at the $1000 levels. If either of the supports hold, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA and rally to $1,400 levels. We shall wait for the virtual currency to find some support before suggesting any trades. EOS/USD EOS spiked after its EOSIO 1.0 launch and came close to its first target objective of $15.6356, specified in our previous analysis. However, we have not recommended any positions because we don’t trade during major events due to the high level of uncertainty. The EOS/USD pair is witnessing profit taking at higher levels and is likely to retest the breakout levels at $12.9870. The 20-day EMA is also located just above this level. If the level holds, the bulls will try to resume the up move towards $18.67 levels once again but if the support breaks, the digital currency will re-enter the range and can slump back to $10.3384 levels. We shall wait for more clarity to emerge before recommending any trade on it. LTC/USD Litecoin has turned down from the $127 levels, which is a major resistance. Its downside support is at $115.447, which is the intraday low of May 30. If this level breaks, a slide to $107.102 is possible. However, if the level holds, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance. If the LTC/USD pair breaks out of $127, it can rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle, close to $150. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $127 with a close stop loss. We recommend to keep the allocation size less than 50 percent of usual for this trade because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish pattern. The negative setup will be invalidated if the bulls break out of $160. ADA/USD For the past two days, Cardano broke above the $0.23 levels on an intraday basis but could not close (UTC time frame) above it. Hence, our buy recommendation suggested in the previous analysis did not trigger. Currently, the ADA/USD pair has turned down. It has a strong support at the $0.17 levels. If this level breaks, a slide to the bottom of the large range at $0.13 is possible. Nonetheless, if the bulls stem the current weakness and cause a turnaround, a break out of the $0.23 levels should be positive. The 50-day SMA might act as a minor resistance but we expect this level to be crossed. Hence, we retain our buy recommendation provided in the previous analysis. XLM/USD Stellar closed (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA by a small margin on June 03, triggering our buy suggestion provided in the previous analysis. The bulls failed to build on the gains above the 20-day EMA resulting in a decline below the moving average and the horizontal line today. The 20-day EMA is flat and the 50-day SMA is also turning flat. This increases the probability of a range formation in the near term. We shall watch for a couple of days and close the position if the XLM/USD pair doesn’t rise above $0.32. On the downside, support is at $0.242 and below that at the $0.184 levels. IOTA/USD IOTA broke out of the 50-day SMA on June 03 but could not sustain the higher levels. It turned down from just above $2 levels and is currently taking support at the 20-day EMA. A break of this can extend the decline to $1.63, which is a strong support. If the bulls successfully defend the $1.63 levels for a couple of days, the traders can consider it as a buying opportunity with the stops below the $1.3 levels. Long positions should be avoided if the IOTA/USD pair breaks down of $1.63 because the next support on the downside is at $1.33 and below that at the bottom of the range at $0.9150.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

It’s limited.\n“In terms of dollars bitcoin will go up and up overtime.\n“And it won’t happen fast, it may be sloppy at first and things that change so much in life take a very long time to change, they tend to go slowly.\n“We had a crash in the internet age and I see that going on with a lot of blockchain things including bitcoin itself right now.\n“Blockchain in all forms is so popular and being studied by so many people and in demand by so many companies to look into changing their businesses in the future, it may be long term.\n“I do see it as a bubble in the sense there is a huge amount of interest in it right now, but things aren’t going to change that rapidly, that’s what the internet bubble was all about.”\nThe tech pioneer argued people will have to change their mindset just like they did when internet was introduced, to truly see the future of the blockchain technology.\nHe said: “People have to have their mindset change, culture and tradition and status quo and the way things are doesn’t change that rapidly when it’s that huge.”\nIn May, Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey declared his hope Bitcoin will continue to establish itself as a primary method of payments.\nHe said: “I hope it will be bitcoin. I’m a huge fan.”\nMr Dorsey added the internet “deserves a native currency” but admitted he was not certain if Bitcoin would prove to be successful in the long term.\nHe went on: “I’m just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency.\n“It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be Bitcoin but I hope it will be.”\nThe CEO declared if cryptocurrencies were used as a global currency it would allow Square to enter new markets around the world more easily.\nHe remarked: “If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin", "https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=world"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T23:17:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51a887915669b3b8d695094216180fd09707d89d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd3EwflFCZl5.WgdNFBBuBY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Meta", "title": "A description of the Bitcoin Talk merit system", "title_full": "A description of the Bitcoin Talk merit system", "published": "2018-06-04T22:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51a887915669b3b8d695094216180fd09707d89d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd3EwflFCZl5.WgdNFBBuBY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jet Cash", "published": "2018-06-04T22:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "A description of the Bitcoin Talk merit system", "text": "Apologies for starting yet another merit thread, but I have yet to see a comprehensive description, and i hope I have created one on my blog.\nThis is the teaser.\nQuote: The Bitcoin Talk merit system was introduced to help combat spam and inferior posting, and during the few months that it hs been in operation, it is having some success.

I hope that this article will help my readers to understand the merit structure. I am Jet Cash, and I am a merit source, I am in the list of top awarders of merit, and the list of top receivers.\nPart of the confusions arises from the interchangeable use of the words 'merit' and 'sMerit', and I have replaced those with the words 'medal' and 'credit'. I feel that this makes the description of the system a far easier task.

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin,and ZenCash , are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ ( or miners ) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power.\nWhile that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice.\nBecause the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. Crypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spendhack.\nBlockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way.\nZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As Bitcoinist reports , both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months. They required less hashing power than ZenCash, so it’s possible that this latest attack is just another example ifa trend of upward trajectory attacks that target much more vulnerable cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms.\nFifty-one percent attacks aren’t the only problems faced by Bitcoin and public blockchain platforms, though, these developers are trying to solve them .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.crypto51.app/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-bitcoin-mining/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-bitcoin-alternatives/", "https://bitcoinist.com/zencash-target-51-attack-loses-500k-double-spend-transactions/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/blockchain-problems-how-to-solve-issues-with-the-latest-vogue-tech/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "killeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon martindale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T04:06:22.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f651cb16b412516c7124c1a9e714c550826b53a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSS1KyjLFtb91B9gjkF9bSMrUcWah64HIQ4tV233oVBsGol36of14Zn0wL7bV6woZCQ--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Is someone spamming the Bitcoin Network?", "title_full": "Is someone spamming the Bitcoin Network?", "published": "2018-06-04T22:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f651cb16b412516c7124c1a9e714c550826b53a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSS1KyjLFtb91B9gjkF9bSMrUcWah64HIQ4tV233oVBsGol36of14Zn0wL7bV6woZCQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T22:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is someone spamming the Bitcoin Network?", "text": "Is someone spamming the Bitcoin Network?\n/u/frafrasuperduper\nJust took a look at this Website: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2w Looks for me like someone is spamming many transaction with small fees.

TLDR: to prevent against birthday attacks .\nBitcoin is using two hash iterations (denoted SHA256^2 ie \"SHA256 function squared\") and the reason for this relates to a partial attack on the smaller but related SHA1 hash. SHA1's resistance to birthday attacks has been partially broken as of 2005 in O(2^64) vs the design O(2^80). While hashcash relies on pre-image resistance and so is not vulnerable to birthday attacks, a generic method of hardening SHA1 against the birthday collision attack is to iterate it twice. A comparable attack on SHA256 does not exist so far, however as the design of SHA256 is similar to SHA1 it is probably defensive for applications to use double SHA256. And this is what bitcoin does, it is not necessary given hashcash reliance on preimage security, but it is a defensive step against future cryptanalytic developments. The attack on SHA1 and in principle other hashes of similar design like SHA256, was also the motivation for the NIST SHA3 design competition which is still ongoing.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashcash", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nist", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:17:22.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "184f6e4286e140ae0611c6500dfc205ea51312ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pffc6rP46A_mb3ZAXbM.hu02bgJnVTi3M6n9g4BAEPEG_4ZHi5kKAKcmGUpHv0kMTeQmibxeaSdSYDqfP4zQJRw--", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin Will Become the New Gold Standard: Bladetec Managing Director", "title_full": "Bitcoin Will Become the New Gold Standard: Bladetec Managing Director", "published": "2018-06-04T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/video-interview-header-10.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "184f6e4286e140ae0611c6500dfc205ea51312ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pffc6rP46A_mb3ZAXbM.hu02bgJnVTi3M6n9g4BAEPEG_4ZHi5kKAKcmGUpHv0kMTeQmibxeaSdSYDqfP4zQJRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-06-04T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Will Become the New Gold Standard: Bladetec Managing Director", "text": "Bitcoin Will Become the New Gold Standard: Bladetec Managing Director by 0\nFinance Magnates LTD is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected as provided in this Privacy Policy.

Bitcoin, if Wright is right, he can transfer some part of those oldest Bitcoins to a different address in order to prove the possession of the private keys of those early Bitcoins.\nThe Industry Calls him a Scammer, Why?\nYesterday, Wright offered cryptographic key as proof of his work, backed up by other technical information , to convince the cryptography community that he is behind the pseudonym, Nakamoto.\nHowever, the community described Wright’s proof as \" flimflam and hokum \" that ultimately did not demonstrate any non-public information about Nakamoto.\nIt speculated that Wright \"used amateur magician tactics to distract non-technical or non-expert staff of the BBC and the Economist during a stage-managed demonstration.\"\nRobert Graham, a well-known security researcher, published an interesting technical blog post, “ How Craig Wright's Deception Worked”, demonstrated step-by-step how Wright might have scammed so cleverly.\nWright's proof has not convinced the wider public, but if he moves one of Nakamoto's Bitcoins, as promised, it will convince a majority of skeptical cryptographer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Gradual digitalization of money nowadays has resulted in many cryptocurrency-related ideas rising to the surface. For instance, a Bitcoin shop, which offers consultancy services and where many cryptocurrencies are traded, has recently opened in Istanbul's Grand Bazaar\nThe optimisticatmosphere created by Bitcoin, which has become a phenomenon in recent years, allows cryptocurrencies to be used in both investment and money transfer transactions, while the loss of the physical nature of money and its introduction to digitalization enables various ideas and methods to emerge, giving different dimensions to cryptocurrency.\nThe Bitcoin shop, which has started to operate in Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, provides consultancy services to those who want to carry out transactions in big stock markets with cryptocurrencies and trade them with commission.\nBitcoin achieved over a 20-fold increase in value in 2017, reaching around $20,000 towards the end of the year, while the usage of cryptocurrencies in both investment and money transfer transactions has found a broad coverage on the agenda.\nCryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Mono, Dash, Tether, NEO, Ontology, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, TRON, NEM, EOS, IOTA, Cardano and Vechain are traded alongside Bitcoin on the shop's price screen. Ugur Hakan Çakan, CEO of Bitcoin shop which started operating in Istanbul Grand Bazaar, stated that they gave consultancy services to citizens about cryptocurrencies.\n\"Here we are intermediaries between stock exchanges and people. People can carry out their transactions here face to face. When they come to us, first of all, we give them information about the crypto world, the block-chain system and what might happen in the future,\" Çakan said.\nThe most important feature that distinguishes Bitcoin is that it does not require the authority of a third party, such as a government or central bank, and changes the handset directly between the buyer and the seller in the digital environment. Today, especially in developed countries, the use of paper money is decreasing day by day and expenditures are often made with digital currency. Even though the process is still in its infancy, the growing influence of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the high demand for them are increasingly enabling them to function as an alternative currency.\n\"We cannot give coin recommendations when they make their investment decisions, but we give them the necessary information to review their coins,\" Çakan said, adding that citizens show great interest in cryptocurrency.\n\"We have reached our goal in terms of generating interest because our target audience, those who do not have anything to do with this issue and cannot do research on the internet, is given face to face information here,\" he continued. \"We are very happy that Aunt Ayşe and Uncle Mehmet are coming to us. They get all the information they want. We do research where we do not have information and get back to them. The Turkish people are very interested in cryptocurrency right now.\"\nHe remarked that they gave consultancy services to citizens who have no information about cryptocurrency, even giving them assignments so that they can understand the system better.\nNoting that the blockchain system is one of the most reliable structures in the world, Çakan said that cryptocurrency is a product of this system and that they give information about these products. \"We give information about the risks of the investment they want to make. We are careful not to take action the first time so that they can do some research and get into the business. We give them assignments, providing them with some links.

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom. Also read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Zencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends The Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization. According to a released statement , the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations. The attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices. According to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115. At the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted. Ticketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover Ticketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline. In correspondence with Motherboard , the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online. “We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports. It’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago. Avalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets Avalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies. World Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins. Earlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued. Avalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions. All of them will be offered the option and will be entitled to a full refund of all subscription proceeds tendered to the company. What are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Bitcoin Developers Call For GitHub Exit The takeover, which anonymous sources claim should see an official announcement later Monday, has led to multiple calls to remove Bitcoin activity from the code repository. Github had previously stated it would strive to remain independent, even planning an IPO in 2017. The company’s CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath resigned in August, with executives “struggling” to find a suitable replacement since, Business Insider reported when it first broke the news Friday. Bitcoin development has traditionally used the website as a global participation environment. Unsurprisingly, news of a corporate takeover failed to impress community figures, who demanded Bitcoin activity be taken elsewhere. “Yes,” Bitcoin core developer Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote on Twitter when asked whether developers should abandon GitHub permanently. “No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of (GitHub) toward obsolence (sic), possibly ending the same way as codeplex did,” he explained. To be clear: many bitcoin core contributors already preferred moving to independently hosted infrastructure in the long run. This may or may not speed it up. Rival Service Sees 10X Growth Others continued the narrative that Microsoft would stunt the project’s potential. “There is no GitHub replacement, we all know (Microsoft) will run it into the ground,” one Twitter comment reads in response to criticism of the potential bill Microsoft paid for ownership. You could've acquired Github too. All you had to do is create a $2 billion ICO. https://t.co/0LKn8x3Lgh — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) June 4, 2018 In future, Bitcoin development could move to rival independent service GitLab, a trending hashtag #movingtogitlab already doing the rounds online. On Sunday, two days after the Microsoft rumors began circulating, the company reported ten times the usual number of projects migrating amid efforts to keep up with demand. “We’re scaling our fleet to try to stay up,” officials announced, reproducing data confirming the giant spike in migration from GitHub.

Argentinian non-profit organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have just launched a cryptocurrency awareness campaign “Bitcoineta,” local news outlet Infobae reports Monday, June 4.\nThe campaign’s name is an abbreviation from “Bitcoin” and “camioneta,” the Spanish word for minivan.\nIt consists of a Bitcoin-branded van, jointly purchased by the two participating organizations, that will go around Argentinian - and eventually Latin American - towns to spread basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies among local communities.\nThe idea behind Bitcoineta is to reach each village and town in the country to “show people how they can take advantage” of cryptocurrencies, the founder of the project Gabriel Kurman said.\nThe van is equipped with all the necessities to travel all over the country and, in the long term, all over Latin America. In addition to all the other tools, it has a projector to demonstrate crypto-related movies and presentations.\nBitcoineta’s first destination was Chascomus, a rural place some 120 kilometers away from Buenos Aires. The van arrived there on June 1 to give a short lecture on blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the locals. Nos fuimos de #Chascomus !
